    "Description": "Gloomhaven  is a game of Euro-inspired tactical combat in a persistent world of shifting motives. Players will take on the role of a wandering adventurer with their own special set of skills and their own reasons for traveling to this dark corner of the world. Players must work together out of necessity to clear out menacing dungeons and forgotten ruins. In the process,  they will enhance their abilities with experience and loot,  discover new locations to explore and plunder,  and expand an ever-branching story fueled by the decisions they make.<br/><br/>This is a game with a persistent and changing world that is ideally played over many game sessions. After a scenario,  players will make decisions on what to do,  which will determine how the story continues,  kind of like a &ldquo;Choose Your Own Adventure&rdquo; book. Playing through a scenario is a cooperative affair where players will fight against automated monsters using an innovative card system to determine the order of play and what a player does on their turn.<br/><br/>Each turn,  a player chooses two cards to play out of their hand. The number on the top card determines their initiative for the round. Each card also has a top and bottom power,  and when it is a player&rsquo;s turn in the initiative order,  they determine whether to use the top power of one card and the bottom power of the other,  or vice-versa. Players must be careful,  though,  because over time they will permanently lose cards from their hands. If they take too long to clear a dungeon,  they may end up exhausted and be forced to retreat.<br/><br/>",

    "Description": "Pandemic Legacy is a co-operative campaign game,  with an overarching story-arc played through 12-24 sessions,  depending on how well your group does at the game. At the beginning,  the game starts very similar to basic Pandemic,  in which your team of disease-fighting specialists races against the clock to travel around the world,  treating disease hotspots while researching cures for each of four plagues before they get out of hand.<br/><br/>During a player's turn,  they have four actions available,  with which they may travel around in the world in various ways (sometimes needing to discard a card),  build structures like research stations,  treat diseases (removing one cube from the board; if all cubes of a color have been removed,  the disease has been eradicated),  trade cards with other players,  or find a cure for a disease (requiring five cards of the same color to be discarded while at a research station). Each player has a unique role with special abilities to help them at these actions.<br/><br/>After a player has taken their actions,  they draw two cards. These cards can include epidemic cards,  which will place new disease cubes on the board,  and can lead to an outbreak,  spreading disease cubes even further. Outbreaks additionally increase the panic level of a city,  making that city more expensive to travel to.<br/><br/>Each month in the game,  you have two chances to achieve that month's objectives. If you succeed,  you win and immediately move on to the next month. If you fail,  you have a second chance,  with more funding for beneficial event cards.<br/><br/>During the campaign,  new rules and components will be introduced. These will sometimes require you to permanently alter the components of the game; this includes writing on cards,  ripping up cards,  and placing permanent stickers on components. Your characters can gain new skills,  or detrimental effects. A character can even be lost entirely,  at which point it's no longer available for play.<br/><br/>Part of the Pandemic series<br/><br/>",

This earns you money and victory points. Needless to say,  each time you arrive in Kansas City,  you want to have your most valuable cattle in tow. However,  the &quot;Great Western Trail&quot; not only requires that you keep your herd in good shape,  but also that you wisely use the various buildings along the trail. Also,  it might be a good idea to hire capable staff: cowboys to improve your herd,  craftsmen to build your very own buildings,  or engineers for the important railroad line.<br/><br/>If you cleverly manage your herd and navigate the opportunities and pitfalls of Great Western Trail,  you surely will gain the most victory points and win the game.<br/><br/>The first edition of Great Western Trail was released with a player count of 2-4,  with some people making solo rules on their own,  while the second edition will include solitaire rules,  making for a player count of 1-4.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

    "Description": "In War of the Ring,  one player takes control of the Free Peoples (FP),  the other player controls Shadow Armies (SA). Initially,  the Free People Nations are reluctant to take arms against Sauron,  so they must be attacked by Sauron or persuaded by Gandalf or other Companions,  before they start to fight properly: this is represented by the Political Track,  which shows if a Nation is ready to fight in the War of the Ring or not.<br/><br/>The game can be won by a military victory,  if Sauron conquers a certain number of Free People cities and strongholds or vice versa. But the true hope of the Free Peoples lies with the quest of the Ringbearer: while the armies clash across Middle Earth,  the Fellowship of the Ring is trying to get secretly to Mount Doom to destroy the One Ring. Sauron is not aware of the real intention of his enemies but is looking across Middle Earth for the precious Ring,  so that the Fellowship is going to face numerous dangers,  represented by the rules of The Hunt for the Ring. But the Companions can spur the Free Peoples to the fight against Sauron,  so the Free People player must balance the need to protect the Ringbearer from harm,  against the attempt to raise a proper defense against the armies of the Shadow,  so that they do not overrun Middle Earth before the Ringbearer completes his quest.<br/><br/>Each game turn revolves around the roll of Action Dice: each die corresponds to an action that a player can do during a turn. Depending on the face rolled on each die,  different actions are possible (moving armies,  characters,  recruiting troops,  advancing a Political Track).<br/><br/>Action Dice can also be used to draw or play Event Cards. Event Cards are played to represent specific events from the story (or events that could possibly have happened) that cannot be portrayed through normal game-play. Each Event Card can also create an unexpected turn in the game,  allowing special actions or altering the course of a battle.<br/><br/>",

    "Description": "In the most distant reaches of the world,  magic still exists,  embodied by spirits of the land,  of the sky,  and of every natural thing. As the great powers of Europe stretch their colonial empires further and further,  they will inevitably lay claim to a place where spirits still hold power - and when they do,  the land itself will fight back alongside the islanders who live there.<br/><br/>Spirit Island is a complex and thematic cooperative game about defending your island home from colonizing Invaders. Players are different spirits of the land,  each with its own unique elemental powers. Every turn,  players simultaneously choose which of their power cards to play,  paying energy to do so. Using combinations of power cards that match a spirit's elemental affinities can grant free bonus effects. Faster powers take effect immediately,  before the Invaders spread and ravage,  but other magics are slower,  requiring forethought and planning to use effectively. In the Spirit phase,  spirits gain energy,  and choose how / whether to Grow: to reclaim used power cards,  to seek for new power,  or to spread presence into new areas of the island.<br/><br/>The Invaders expand across the island map in a semi-predictable fashion. Each turn they explore into some lands (portions of the island); the next turn,  they build in those lands,  forming settlements and cities. The turn after that,  they ravage there,  bringing blight to the land and attacking any native islanders present.<br/><br/>The islanders fight back against the Invaders when attacked,  and lend the spirits some other aid,  but may not always do so exactly as you'd hoped. Some Powers work through the islanders,  helping them (eg) drive out the Invaders or clean the land of blight.<br/><br/>The game escalates as it progresses: spirits spread their presence to new parts of the island and seek out new and more potent powers,  while the Invaders step up their colonization efforts. Each turn represents 1-3 years of alternate-history.<br/><br/>At game start,  winning requires destroying every last settlement and city on the board - but as you frighten the Invaders more and more,  victory becomes easier: they'll run away even if some number of settlements or cities remain. Defeat comes if any spirit is destroyed,  if the island is overrun by blight,  or if the Invader deck is depleted before achieving victory.<br/><br/>The game includes different adversaries to fight against (eg: a Swedish Mining Colony,  or a Remote British Colony). Each changes play in different ways,  and offers a different path of difficulty boosts to keep the game challenging as you gain skill.<br/><br/>",

    "Description": "It is a time of unrest in 1920s Europa. The ashes from the first great war still darken the snow. The capitalistic city-state known simply as &ldquo;The Factory&rdquo;,  which fueled the war with heavily armored mechs,  has closed its doors,  drawing the attention of several nearby countries.<br/><br/>Scythe is an engine-building game set in an alternate-history 1920s period. It is a time of farming and war,  broken hearts and rusted gears,  innovation and valor. In Scythe,  each player represents a character from one of five factions of Eastern Europe who are attempting to earn their fortune and claim their faction's stake in the land around the mysterious Factory. Players conquer territory,  enlist new recruits,  reap resources,  gain villagers,  build structures,  and activate monstrous mechs.<br/><br/>Each player begins the game with different resources (power,  coins,  combat acumen,  and popularity),  a different starting location,  and a hidden goal. Starting positions are specially calibrated to contribute to each faction&rsquo;s uniqueness and the asymmetrical nature of the game (each faction always starts in the same place).<br/><br/>Scythe gives players almost complete control over their fate. Other than each player&rsquo;s individual hidden objective card,  the only elements of luck or variability are &ldquo;encounter&rdquo; cards that players will draw as they interact with the citizens of newly explored lands. Each encounter card provides the player with several options,  allowing them to mitigate the luck of the draw through their selection. Combat is also driven by choices,  not luck or randomness.<br/><br/>Scythe uses a streamlined action-selection mechanism (no rounds or phases) to keep gameplay moving at a brisk pace and reduce downtime between turns. While there is plenty of direct conflict for players who seek it,  there is no player elimination.<br/><br/>Every part of Scythe has an aspect of engine-building to it. Players can upgrade actions to become more efficient,  build structures that improve their position on the map,  enlist new recruits to enhance character abilities,  activate mechs to deter opponents from invading,  and expand their borders to reap greater types and quantities of resources. These engine-building aspects create a sense of momentum and progress throughout the game. The order in which players improve their engine adds to the unique feel of each game,  even when playing one faction multiple times.<br/><br/>",

    "Description": "The game is set in the Burgundy region of High Medieval France. Each player takes on the role of an aristocrat,  originally controlling a small princedom. While playing they aim to build settlements and powerful castles,  practice trade along the river,  exploit silver mines,  and use the knowledge of travelers.<br/><br/>The game is about players taking settlement tiles from the game board and placing them into their princedom which is represented by the player board. Every tile has a function that starts when the tile is placed in the princedom. The princedom itself consists of several regions,  each of which demands its own type of settlement tile.<br/><br/>The game is played in five phases,  each consisting of five rounds.  Each phase begins with the game board stocked with settlement tiles and goods tiles.  At the beginning of each round all players roll their two dice,  and the player who is currently first in turn order rolls a goods placement die.  A goods tile is made available on the game board according to the roll of the goods die.  During each round players take their turns in the current turn order.  During his turn,  a player may perform any two of the four possible types of actions: 1) take a settlement tile from the numbered depot on the game board corresponding to one of his dice and place it in the staging area on his player board,  2) take a settlement tile from the staging area of his player board to a space on his player board with a number matching one of his dice in the corresponding region for the type of tile and adjacent to a previously placed settlement tile,  3) deliver goods with a number matching one of his dice,  or 4) take worker tokens which allow the player to adjust the roll of his dice.  In addition to these actions a player may buy a settlement tile from the central depot on the game board and place it in the staging area on his player board.  If an action triggers the award of victory points,  those points are immediately recorded.  Each settlement tile offers a benefit,  additional actions,  additional money,  advancement on the turn order track,  more goods tiles,  die roll adjustment or victory points.  Bonus victory points are awarded for filling a region with settlement tiles.<br/><br/>The game ends when the last player finishes his turn of the fifth round of the fifth phase.  Victory points are awarded for unused money and workers,  and undelivered goods.  Bonus victory points from certain settlement tiles are awarded at the end of the game.<br/><br/>The player with the most victory points wins.<br/><br/>The rules include basic and advanced versions.<br/><br/>This game is #14 in the Alea big box series.<br/><br/>",

Each player governs one of the 14 groups. With subtlety and craft,  the player must attempt to rule as great an area as possible and to develop that group's skills. There are also four religious cults in which you can progress. To do all that,  each group has special skills and abilities.<br/><br/>Taking turns,  the players execute their actions on the resources they have at their disposal. Different buildings allow players to develop different resources. Dwellings allow for more workers. Trading houses allow players to make money. Strongholds unlock a group's special ability,  and temples allow you to develop religion and your terraforming and seafaring skills. Buildings can be upgraded: Dwellings can be developed into trading houses; trading houses can be developed into strongholds or temples; one temple can be upgraded to become a sanctuary. Each group must also develop its terraforming skill and its skill with boats to use the rivers. The groups in question,  along with their home landscape,  are:<br/><br/><br/>    Desert (Fakirs,  Nomads)<br/>    Plains (Halflings,  Cultists)<br/>    Swamp (Alchemists,  Darklings)<br/>    Lake (Mermaids,  Swarmlings)<br/>    Forest (Witches,  Auren)<br/>    Mountain (Dwarves,  Engineers)<br/>    Wasteland (Giants,  Chaos Magicians)<br/><br/><br/>Proximity to other groups is a double-edged sword in Terra Mystica. Being close to other groups gives you extra power,  but it also means that expanding is more difficult...<br/><br/>",

    "Description": "In many ways 7 Wonders Duel resembles its parent game 7 Wonders as over three ages players acquire cards that provide resources or advance their military or scientific development in order to develop a civilization and complete wonders.<br/><br/>What's different about 7 Wonders Duel is that,  as the title suggests,  the game is solely for two players,  with the players not drafting cards simultaneously from hands of cards,  but from a display of face-down and face-up cards arranged at the start of a round. A player can take a card only if it's not covered by any others,  so timing comes into play as well as bonus moves that allow you to take a second card immediately. As in the original game,  each card that you acquire can be built,  discarded for coins,  or used to construct a wonder.<br/><br/>Each player starts with four wonder cards,  and the construction of a wonder provides its owner with a special ability. Only seven wonders can be built,  though,  so one player will end up short.<br/><br/>Players can purchase resources at any time from the bank,  or they can gain cards during the game that provide them with resources for future building; as you acquire resources,  the cost for those particular resources increases for your opponent,  representing your dominance in this area.<br/><br/>A player can win 7 Wonders Duel in one of three ways: each time you acquire a military card,  you advance the military marker toward your opponent's capital,  giving you a bonus at certain positions; if you reach the opponent's capital,  you win the game immediately; similarly,  if you acquire any six of seven different scientific symbols,  you achieve scientific dominance and win immediately; if none of these situations occurs,  then the player with the most points at the end of the game wins.<br/><br/>",

    "Description": "Two thousand years ago,  the Roman Empire ruled the lands around the Mediterranean Sea. With peace at the borders,  harmony inside the provinces,  uniform law,  and a common currency,  the economy thrived and gave rise to mighty Roman dynasties as they expanded throughout the numerous cities. Guide one of these dynasties and send colonists to the remote realms of the Empire; develop your trade network; and appease the ancient gods for their favor &mdash; all to gain the chance to emerge victorious!<br/><br/>Concordia is a peaceful strategy game of economic development in Roman times for 2-5 players aged 13 and up. Instead of looking to the luck of dice or cards,  players must rely on their strategic abilities. Be sure to watch your rivals to determine which goals they are pursuing and where you can outpace them! In the game,  colonists are sent out from Rome to settle down in cities that produce bricks,  food,  tools,  wine,  and cloth. Each player starts with an identical set of playing cards and acquires more cards during the game. These cards serve two purposes:<br/><br/><br/>    They allow a player to choose actions during the game.<br/>    They are worth victory points (VPs) at the end of the game. <br/><br/><br/>Concordia is a strategy game that requires advance planning and consideration of your opponent's moves. Every game is different,  not only because of the sequence of new cards on sale but also due to the modular layout of cities. (One side of the game board shows the entire Roman Empire with 30 cities for 3-5 players,  while the other shows Roman Italy with 25 cities for 2-4 players.) When all cards have been sold or after the first player builds his 15th house,  the game ends. The player with the most VPs from the gods (Jupiter,  Saturnus,  Mercurius,  Minerva,  Vesta,  etc.) wins the game.<br/><br/>",

    "Description": "Brass: Lancashire &mdash; first published as Brass &mdash; is an economic strategy game that tells the story of competing cotton entrepreneurs in Lancashire during the industrial revolution. You must develop,  build,  and establish your industries and network so that you can capitalize demand for iron,  coal and cotton. The game is played over two halves: the canal phase and the rail phase. To win the game,  score the most victory points (VPs),  which are counted at the end of each half. VPs are gained from your canals,  rails,  and established (flipped) industry tiles. Each round,  players take turns according to the turn order track,  receiving two actions to perform any of the following:<br/><br/><br/>    Build an industry tile<br/>    Build a rail or canal<br/>    Develop an industry<br/>    Sell cotton<br/>    Take a loan<br/><br/><br/>At the end of a player's turn,  they replace the two cards they played with two more from the deck. Turn order is determined by how much money a player spent on the previous turn,  from lowest spent first to highest spent. This turn order mechanism opens some strategic options for players going later in the turn order,  allowing for the possibility of back-to-back turns.<br/><br/>After all the cards have been played the first time (with the deck size being adjusted for the number of players),  the canal phase ends and a scoring round commences. After scoring,  all canals and all of the lowest level industries are removed for the game,  after which new cards are dealt and the rail phase begins. During this phase,  players may now occupy more than one location in a city and a double-connection build (though expensive) is possible. At the end of the rail phase,  another scoring round takes place,  then a winner is crowned.<br/><br/>The cards limit where you can build your industries,  but any card can be used for the develop,  sell cotton or build connections actions. This leads to a strategic timing/storing of cards. Resources are common so that if one player builds a rail line (which requires coal) they have to use the coal from the nearest source,  which may be an opponent's coal mine,  which in turn gets that coal mine closer to scoring (i.e.,  being utilized).<br/><br/>Brass: Lancashire,  the 2018 edition from Roxley Games,  reboots the original Warfrog Games edition of Brass with new artwork and components,  as well as a few rules changes:<br/><br/><br/>     The virtual link rules between Birkenhead have been made optional.<br/>     The three-player experience has been brought closer to the ideal experience of four players by shortening each half of the game by one round and tuning the deck and distant market tiles slightly to ensure a consistent experience.<br/>     Two-player rules have been created and are playable without the need for an alternate board.<br/>     The level 1 cotton mill is now worth 5 VP to make it slightly less terrible.<br/><br/><br/>",

    "Description": "Brass: Birmingham is an economic strategy game sequel to Martin Wallace' 2007 masterpiece,  Brass. Birmingham tells the story of competing entrepreneurs in Birmingham during the industrial revolution,  between the years of 1770-1870.<br/><br/>As in its predecessor,  you must develop,  build,  and establish your industries and network,  in an effort to exploit low or high market demands.<br/><br/>Each round,  players take turns according to the turn order track,  receiving two actions to perform any of the following actions (found in the original game):<br/><br/>1) Build - Pay required resources and place an industry tile.<br/>2) Network - Add a rail / canal link,  expanding your network.<br/>3) Develop - Increase the VP value of an industry.<br/>4) Sell - Sell your cotton,  manufactured goods and pottery.<br/>5) Loan - Take a &pound;30 loan and reduce your income.<br/><br/>Brass: Birmingham also features a new sixth action:<br/><br/>6) Scout - Discard three cards and take a wild location and wild industry card. (This action replaces Double Action Build in original Brass.)<br/><br/>The game is played over two halves: the canal era (years 1770-1830) and the rail era (years 1830-1870). To win the game,  score the most VPs. VPs are counted at the end of each half for the canals,  rails and established (flipped) industry tiles.<br/><br/>Birmingham features dynamic scoring canals/rails. Instead of each flipped industry tile giving a static 1 VP to all connected canals and rails,  many industries give 0 or even 2 VPs. This provides players with the opportunity to score much higher value canals in the first era,  and creates interesting strategy with industry placement.<br/><br/>Iron,  coal,  and cotton are three industries which appear in both the original Brass as well as in Brass: Birmingham.<br/><br/>New &quot;Sell&quot; system<br/><br/>Brewing has become a fundamental part of the culture in Birmingham. You must now sell your product through traders located around the edges of the board. Each of these traders is looking for a specific type of good each game. To sell cotton,  pottery,  or manufactured goods to these traders,  you must also &quot;grease the wheels of industry&quot; by consuming beer. For example,  a level 1 cotton mill requires one beer to flip. As an incentive to sell early,  the first player to sell to a trader receives free beer.<br/><br/>Birmingham features three all-new industry types:<br/><br/>Brewery - Produces precious beer barrels required to sell goods.<br/><br/>Manufactured goods - Function like cotton,  but features eight levels. Each level of manufactured goods provides unique rewards,  rather than just escalating in VPs,  making it a more versatile (yet potentially more difficult) path vs cotton.<br/><br/>Pottery - These behemoths of Birmingham offer huge VPs,  but at a huge cost and need to plan.<br/><br/>Increased Coal and Iron Market size - The price of coal and iron can now go up to &pound;8 per cube,  and it's not uncommon.<br/><br/>Brass: Birmingham is a sequel to Brass. It offers a very different story arc and experience from its predecessor.<br/><br/>",

You are reliving the cultural achievements,  mercantile expeditions,  and pillages of those tribes we know as Viking today &mdash; a term that was used quite differently towards the end of the first millennium.<br/><br/>When the northerners went out for a raid,  they used to say they headed out for a viking. Their Scandinavian ancestors,  however,  were much more than just pirates. They were explorers and founders of states. Leif Eriksson is said to be the first European in America,  long before Columbus.<br/>In what is known today as Normandy,  the intruders were not called Vikings but Normans. One of them is the famous William the Conqueror who invaded England in 1066. He managed to do what the king of Norway failed to do only a few years prior: conquer the Throne of England. The reason why the people of these times became such strong seafarers is due to their unfortunate agricultural situation. Crop shortfalls caused great distress.<br/><br/>In this game,  you will raid and explore new territories. You will also experience their day-to-day activities: collecting goods to achieve a financially secure position in society. In the end,  the player whose possessions bear the greatest value will be declared the winner.<br/><br/>",

Blurring the traditional lines between role-playing and card game experiences,  Arkham Horror: The Card Game is a Living Card Game of Lovecraftian mystery,  monsters,  and madness!<br/><br/>In the game,  you and your friend (or up to three friends with two Core Sets) become characters within the quiet New England town of Arkham. You have your talents,  sure,  but you also have your flaws. Perhaps you've dabbled a little too much in the writings of the Necronomicon,  and its words continue to haunt you. Perhaps you feel compelled to cover up any signs of otherworldly evils,  hampering your own investigations in order to protect the quiet confidence of the greater population. Perhaps you'll be scarred by your encounters with a ghoulish cult.<br/><br/>No matter what compels you,  no matter what haunts you,  you'll find both your strengths and weaknesses reflected in your custom deck of cards,  and these cards will be your resources as you work with your friends to unravel the world's most terrifying mysteries.<br/><br/>Each of your adventures in Arkham Horror LCG carries you deeper into mystery. You'll find cultists and foul rituals. You'll find haunted houses and strange creatures. And you may find signs of the Ancient Ones straining against the barriers to our world...<br/><br/>The basic mode of play in Arkham LCG is not the adventure,  but the campaign. You might be scarred by your adventures,  your sanity may be strained,  and you may alter Arkham's landscape,  burning buildings to the ground. All your choices and actions have consequences that reach far beyond the immediate resolution of the scenario at hand&mdash;and your actions may earn you valuable experience with which you can better prepare yourself for the adventures that still lie before you.<br/><br/>",

    "Description": "In Viticulture,  the players find themselves in the roles of people in rustic,  pre-modern Tuscany who have inherited meager vineyards. They have a few plots of land,  an old crushpad,  a tiny cellar,  and three workers. They each have a dream of being the first to call their winery a true success.<br/><br/>The players are in the position of determining how they want to allocate their workers throughout the year. Every season is different on a vineyard,  so the workers have different tasks they can take care of in the summer and winter. There's competition over those tasks,  and often the first worker to get to the job has an advantage over subsequent workers.<br/><br/>Fortunately for the vineyard owners,  people love to visit wineries,  and it just so happens that many of those visitors are willing to help out around the vineyard when they visit as long as you assign a worker to take care of them. Their visits (in the form of cards) are brief but can be very helpful.<br/><br/>Using those workers and visitors,  the vineyard owners can expand their vineyards by building structures,  planting vines,  and filling wine orders,  working towards the goal of running the most successful winery in Tuscany.<br/><br/>Viticulture Essential Edition includes the base game of Viticulture and a few of the most popular modules from the original Tuscany expansion,  including Mamas &amp; Papas,  Fields (previously known as Properties),  expanded and revised Visitors,  and Automa cards for a solo variant,  along with a few minor rule changes.<br/><br/>",

    "Description": "Playing Nemesis will take you into the heart of sci-fi survival horror in all its terror. A soldier fires blindly down a corridor,  trying to stop the alien advance. A scientist races to find a solution in his makeshift lab. A traitor steals the last escape pod in the very last moment. Intruders you meet on the ship are not only reacting to the noise you make but also evolve as the time goes by. The longer the game takes,  the stronger they become. During the game,  you control one of the crew members with a unique set of skills,  personal deck of cards,  and individual starting equipment. These heroes cover all your basic SF horror needs. For example,  the scientist is great with computers and research,  but will have a hard time in combat. The soldier,  on the other hand...<br/><br/>Nemesis is a semi-cooperative game in which you and your crewmates must survive on a ship infested with hostile organisms. To win the game,  you have to complete one of the two objectives dealt to you at the start of the game and get back to Earth in one piece. You will find many obstacles on your way: swarms of Intruders (the name given to the alien organisms by the ship AI),  the poor physical condition of the ship,  agendas held by your fellow players,  and sometimes just cruel fate.<br/><br/>The gameplay of Nemesis is designed to be full of climactic moments which,  hopefully,  you will find rewarding even when your best plans are ruined and your character meets a terrible fate.<br/><br/>",

    "Description": "In Puerto Rico,  players assume the roles of colonial governors on the island of Puerto Rico. The aim of the game is to amass victory points by shipping goods to Europe or by constructing buildings.<br/><br/>Each player uses a separate small board with spaces for city buildings,  plantations,  and resources. Shared between the players are three ships,  a trading house,  and a supply of resources and doubloons.<br/><br/>The resource cycle of the game is that players grow crops which they exchange for points or doubloons. Doubloons can then be used to buy buildings,  which allow players to produce more crops or give them other abilities. Buildings and plantations do not work unless they are manned by colonists.<br/><br/>During each round,  players take turns selecting a role card from those on the table (such as &quot;Trader&quot; or &quot;Builder&quot;). When a role is chosen,  every player gets to take the action appropriate to that role. The player that selected the role also receives a small privilege for doing so - for example,  choosing the &quot;Builder&quot; role allows all players to construct a building,  but the player who chose the role may do so at a discount on that turn. Unused roles gain a doubloon bonus at the end of each turn,  so the next player who chooses that role gets to keep any doubloon bonus associated with it. This encourages players to make use of all the roles throughout a typical course of a game.<br/><br/>Puerto Rico uses a variable phase order mechanism in which a &quot;governor&quot; token is passed clockwise to the next player at the conclusion of a turn. The player with the token begins the round by choosing a role and taking the first action.<br/><br/>Players earn victory points for owning buildings,  for shipping goods,  and for manned &quot;large buildings.&quot; Each player's accumulated shipping chips are kept face down and come in denominations of one or five. This prevents other players from being able to determine the exact score of another player. Goods and doubloons are placed in clear view of other players and the totals of each can always be requested by a player. As the game enters its later stages,  the unknown quantity of shipping tokens and its denominations require players to consider their options before choosing a role that can end the game.<br/><br/>In 2011 and mostly afterwards,  Puerto Rico was published to include both Puerto Rico: Expansion I &ndash; New Buildings and Puerto Rico: Expansion II &ndash; The Nobles. These versions are included in the other game entry Puerto Rico (with two expansions),  not this regular game entry for Puerto Rico. Some editions of Puerto Rico list the player count as 2-5 instead of 3-5,  and they include variant rules for games with only two players.<br/><br/>",

    "Description": "Root is a game of adventure and war in which 2 to 4 (1 to 6 with the 'Riverfolk' expansion) players battle for control of a vast wilderness.<br/><br/>The nefarious Marquise de Cat has seized the great woodland,  intent on harvesting its riches. Under her rule,  the many creatures of the forest have banded together. This Alliance will seek to strengthen its resources and subvert the rule of Cats. In this effort,  the Alliance may enlist the help of the wandering Vagabonds who are able to move through the more dangerous woodland paths. Though some may sympathize with the Alliance&rsquo;s hopes and dreams,  these wanderers are old enough to remember the great birds of prey who once controlled the woods.<br/><br/>Meanwhile,  at the edge of the region,  the proud,  squabbling Eyrie have found a new commander who they hope will lead their faction to resume their ancient birthright. The stage is set for a contest that will decide the fate of the great woodland. It is up to the players to decide which group will ultimately take root.<br/><br/>Root represents the next step in our development of asymmetric design. Like Vast: The Crystal Caverns,  each player in Root has unique capabilities and a different victory condition. Now,  with the aid of gorgeous,  multi-use cards,  a truly asymmetric design has never been more accessible.<br/><br/>The Cats play a game of engine building and logistics while attempting to police the vast wilderness. By collecting Wood they are able to produce workshops,  lumber mills,  and barracks. They win by building new buildings and crafts.<br/><br/>The Eyrie musters their hawks to take back the Woods. They must capture as much territory as possible and build roosts before they collapse back into squabbling.<br/><br/>The Alliance hides in the shadows,  recruiting forces and hatching conspiracies. They begin slowly and build towards a dramatic late-game presence--but only if they can manage to keep the other players in check.<br/><br/>Meanwhile,  the Vagabond plays all sides of the conflict for their own gain,  while hiding a mysterious quest. Explore the board,  fight other factions,  and work towards achieving your hidden goal.<br/><br/>In Root,  players drive the narrative,  and the differences between each role create an unparalleled level of interaction and replayability. Leder Games invites you and your family to explore the fantastic world of Root!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

    "Description": "Following along the same lines as its predecessor (Agricola),  Caverna: The Cave Farmers is a worker-placement game at heart,  with a focus on farming. In the game,  you are the bearded leader of a small dwarf family that lives in a little cave in the mountains. You begin the game with a farmer and his spouse,  and each member of the farming family represents an action that the player can take each turn. Together,  you cultivate the forest in front of your cave and dig deeper into the mountain. You furnish the caves as dwellings for your offspring as well as working spaces for small enterprises.<br/><br/>It's up to you how much ore you want to mine. You will need it to forge weapons that allow you to go on expeditions to gain bonus items and actions. While digging through the mountain,  you may come across water sources and find ore and ruby mines that help you increase your wealth. Right in front of your cave,  you can increase your wealth even further with agriculture: You can cut down the forest to sow fields and fence in pastures to hold your animals. You can also expand your family while running your ever-growing farm. In the end,  the player with the most efficiently developed home board wins.<br/><br/>You can also play the solo variant of this game to familiarize yourself with the 48 different furnishing tiles for your cave.<br/><br/>Caverna: The Cave Farmers,  which has a playing time of roughly 30 minutes per player,  is a complete redesign of Agricola that substitutes the card decks from the former game with a set of buildings while adding the ability to purchase weapons and send your farmers on quests to gain further resources. Designer Uwe Rosenberg says that the game includes parts of Agricola,  but also has new ideas,  especially the cave part of your game board,  where you can build mines and search for rubies. The game also includes two new animals: dogs and donkeys.<br/><br/>",

    "Description": "In the 2400s,  mankind begins to terraform the planet Mars. Giant corporations,  sponsored by the World Government on Earth,  initiate huge projects to raise the temperature,  the oxygen level,  and the ocean coverage until the environment is habitable. In Terraforming Mars,  you play one of those corporations and work together in the terraforming process,  but compete for getting victory points that are awarded not only for your contribution to the terraforming,  but also for advancing human infrastructure throughout the solar system,  and doing other commendable things.<br/><br/>The players acquire unique project cards (from over two hundred different ones) by buying them to their hand. The projects (cards) can represent anything from introducing plant life or animals,  hurling asteroids at the surface,  building cities,  to mining the moons of Jupiter and establishing greenhouse gas industries to heat up the atmosphere. The cards can give you immediate bonuses,  as well as increasing your production of different resources. Many cards also have requirements and they become playable when the temperature,  oxygen,  or ocean coverage increases enough. Buying cards is costly,  so there is a balance between buying cards (3 megacredits per card) and actually playing them (which can cost anything between 0 to 41 megacredits,  depending on the project). Standard Projects are always available to complement your cards.<br/><br/>Your basic income,  as well as your basic score,  is based on your Terraform Rating (starting at 20),  which increases every time you raise one of the three global parameters. However,  your income is complemented with your production,  and you also get VPs from many other sources.<br/><br/>Each player keeps track of their production and resources on their player boards,  and the game uses six types of resources: MegaCredits,  Steel,  Titanium,  Plants,  Energy,  and Heat. On the game board,  you compete for the best places for your city tiles,  ocean tiles,  and greenery tiles. You also compete for different Milestones and Awards worth many VPs. Each round is called a generation (guess why) and consists of the following phases:<br/><br/>1) Player order shifts clockwise.<br/>2) Research phase: All players buy cards from four privately drawn.<br/>3) Action phase: Players take turns doing 1-2 actions from these options: Playing a card,  claiming a Milestone,  funding an Award,  using a Standard project,  converting plant into greenery tiles (and raising oxygen),  converting heat into a temperature raise,  and using the action of a card in play. The turn continues around the table (sometimes several laps) until all players have passed.<br/>4) Production phase: Players get resources according to their terraform rating and production parameters.<br/><br/>When the three global parameters (temperature,  oxygen,  ocean) have all reached their goal,  the terraforming is complete,  and the game ends after that generation. Count your Terraform Rating and other VPs to determine the winning corporation!<br/><br/>",

You might think about having kids in order to get more work accomplished,  but first you need to expand your house. And what are you going to feed all the little rugrats?<br/><br/>The game supports many levels of complexity,  mainly through the use (or non-use) of two of its main types of cards,  Minor Improvements and Occupations. In the beginner's version (called the Family Variant in the U.S. release),  these cards are not used at all. For advanced play,  the U.S. release includes three levels of both types of cards; Basic (E-deck),  Interactive (I-deck),  and Complex (K-deck),  and the rulebook encourages players to experiment with the various decks and mixtures thereof. Aftermarket decks such as the Z-Deck and the L-Deck also exist.<br/><br/>Agricola is a turn-based game. There are 14 game rounds occurring in 6 stages,  with a Harvest at the end of each stage (after Rounds 4,  7,  9,  11,  13,  and 14).<br/>Each player starts with two playing tokens (farmer and spouse) and thus can take two turns,  or actions,  per round. There are multiple options,  and while the game progresses,  you'll have more and more: first thing in a round,  a new action card is flipped over.<br/>Problem: Each action can be taken by only one player each round,  so it's important to do some things with high preference.<br/>Each player also starts with a hand of 7 Occupation cards (of more than 160 total) and 7 Minor Improvement cards (of more than 140 total) that he/she may use during the game if they fit in his/her strategy. Speaking of which,  there are countless strategies,  some depending on your card hand. Sometimes it's a good choice to stay on course,  and sometimes it is better to react to your opponents' actions.<br/><br/>",

    "Description": "&quot;Life is Battle; Battle is Glory; Glory is ALL&quot;<br/><br/>In Blood Rage,  each player controls their own Viking clan&rsquo;s warriors,  leader,  and ship. Ragnar&ouml;k has come,  and it&rsquo;s the end of the world! It&rsquo;s the Vikings&rsquo; last chance to go down in a blaze of glory and secure their place in Valhalla at Odin&rsquo;s side! For a Viking there are many pathways to glory. You can invade and pillage the land for its rewards,  crush your opponents in epic battles,  fulfill quests,  increase your clan's stats,  or even die gloriously either in battle or from Ragnar&ouml;k,  the ultimate inescapable doom.<br/><br/>Most player strategies are guided by the cards drafted at the beginning of each of the three game rounds (or Ages). These &ldquo;Gods&rsquo; Gifts&rdquo; grant you numerous boons for your clan including: increased Viking strength and devious battle strategies,  upgrades to your clan,  or even the aid of legendary creatures from Norse mythology. They may also include various quests,  from dominating specific provinces,  to having lots of your Vikings sent to Valhalla. Most of these cards are aligned with one of the Norse gods,  hinting at the kind of strategy they support. For example,  Thor gives more glory for victory in battle,  Heimdall grants you foresight and surprises,  Tyr strengthens you in battle,  while the trickster Loki actually rewards you for losing battles,  or punishes the winner.<br/><br/>Players must choose their strategies carefully during the draft phase,  but also be ready to adapt and react to their opponents&rsquo; strategies as the action phase unfolds. Battles are decided not only by the strength of the figures involved,  but also by cards played in secret. By observing your opponent&rsquo;s actions and allegiances to specific gods,  you may predict what card they are likely to play,  and plan accordingly. Winning battles is not always the best course of action,  as the right card can get you even more rewards by being crushed. The only losing strategy in Blood Rage is to shy away from battle and a glorious death!<br/><br/>",

These are placed on the board locations,  events,  and on Destination cards. Workers perform various actions to further the development of a player's tableau: gathering resources,  drawing cards,  and taking other special actions.<br/><br/>b) Play a Card: Each player is building and populating a city; a tableau of up to 15 Construction and Critter cards. There are five types of cards: Travelers,  Production,  Destination,  Governance,  and Prosperity. Cards generate resources (twigs,  resin,  pebbles,  and berries),  grant abilities,  and ultimately score points. The interactions of the cards reveal numerous strategies and a near infinite variety of working cities.<br/><br/>c) Prepare for the next Season: Workers are returned to the players supply and new workers are added. The game is played from Winter through to the onset of the following winter,  at which point the player with the city with the most points wins.<br/><br/>",

During the hunt,  you'll encounter a series of stories in a &quot;choose your own adventure&quot; style journey through various events and encounters.

It removes the crayon aspect from network building in the original edition,  while retaining the fluctuating commodities market like Crude: The Oil Game and an auction round intensity reminiscent of The Princes of Florence.<br/><br/>The objective of Power Grid is to supply the most cities with power when someone's network gains a predetermined size.  In this new edition,  players mark pre-existing routes between cities for connection,  and then bid against each other to purchase the power plants that they use to power their cities.<br/><br/>However,  as plants are purchased,  newer,  more efficient plants become available,  so by merely purchasing,  you're potentially allowing others access to superior equipment.<br/><br/>Additionally,  players must acquire the raw materials (coal,  oil,  garbage,  and uranium) needed to power said plants (except for the 'renewable' windfarm/ solar plants,  which require no fuel),  making it a constant struggle to upgrade your plants for maximum efficiency while still retaining enough wealth to quickly expand your network to get the cheapest routes.<br/><br/>Power Grid FAQ - Please read this before posting a rules question!

When placing workers,  they must pay corn,  which is used as a currency in the game. When they pick up a worker,  they perform certain actions depending on the position of the worker. Actions located &quot;later&quot; on the gears are more valuable,  so it's wise to let the time work for you &ndash; but players cannot skip their turn; if they have all their workers on the gears,  they have to pick some up.&nbsp;<br/><br/>The game ends after one full revolution of the central Tzolkin gear.

    "Description": "Twilight Imperium (Fourth Edition) is a game of galactic conquest in which three to six players take on the role of one of seventeen factions vying for galactic domination through military might,  political maneuvering,  and economic bargaining. Every faction offers a completely different play experience,  from the wormhole-hopping Ghosts of Creuss to the Emirates of Hacan,  masters of trade and economics. These seventeen races are offered many paths to victory,  but only one may sit upon the throne of Mecatol Rex as the new masters of the galaxy.<br/><br/>No two games of Twilight Imperium are ever identical. At the start of each galactic age,  the game board is uniquely and strategically constructed using 51 galaxy tiles that feature everything from lush new planets and supernovas to asteroid fields and gravity rifts. Players are dealt a hand of these tiles and take turns creating the galaxy around Mecatol Rex,  the capital planet seated in the center of the board. An ion storm may block your race from progressing through the galaxy while a fortuitously placed gravity rift may protect you from your closest foes. The galaxy is yours to both craft and dominate.<br/><br/>A round of Twilight Imperium begins with players selecting one of eight strategy cards that both determine player order and give their owner a unique strategic action for that round. These may do anything from providing additional command tokens to allowing a player to control trade throughout the galaxy. After these roles are selected,  players take turns moving their fleets from system to system,  claiming new planets for their empire,  and engaging in warfare and trade with other factions. At the end of a turn,  players gather in a grand council to pass new laws and agendas,  shaking up the game in unpredictable ways.<br/><br/>After every player has passed their turn,  players move up the victory track by checking to see whether they have completed any objectives throughout the turn and scoring them. Objectives are determined by setting up ten public objective cards at the start of each game,  then gradually revealing them with every round. Every player also chooses between two random secret objectives at the start of the game,  providing victory points achievable only by the holder of that objective. These objectives can be anything from researching new technologies to taking your neighbor's home system. At the end of every turn,  a player can claim one public objective and one secret objective. As play continues,  more of these objectives are revealed and more secret objectives are dealt out,  giving players dynamically changing goals throughout the game. Play continues until a player reaches ten victory points.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

    "Description": "Star Wars: Imperial Assault is a strategy board game of tactical combat and missions for two to five players,  offering two distinct games of battle and adventure in the Star Wars universe!<br/><br/>Imperial Assault puts you in the midst of the Galactic Civil War between the Rebel Alliance and the Galactic Empire after the destruction of the Death Star over Yavin 4. In this game,  you and your friends can participate in two separate games. The campaign game pits the limitless troops and resources of the Galactic Empire against a crack team of elite Rebel operatives as they strive to break the Empire&rsquo;s hold on the galaxy,  while the skirmish game invites you and a friend to muster strike teams and battle head-to-head over conflicting objectives.<br/><br/>In the campaign game,  Imperial Assault invites you to play through a cinematic tale set in the Star Wars universe. One player commands the seemingly limitless armies of the Galactic Empire,  threatening to extinguish the flame of the Rebellion forever. Up to four other players become heroes of the Rebel Alliance,  engaging in covert operations to undermine the Empire&rsquo;s schemes. Over the course of the campaign,  both the Imperial player and the Rebel heroes gain new experience and skills,  allowing characters to evolve as the story unfolds.<br/><br/>Imperial Assault offers a different game experience in the skirmish game. In skirmish missions,  you and a friend compete in head-to-head,  tactical combat. You&rsquo;ll gather your own strike force of Imperials,  Rebels,  and Mercenaries and build a deck of command cards to gain an unexpected advantage in the heat of battle. Whether you recover lost holocrons or battle to defeat a raiding party,  you&rsquo;ll find danger and tactical choices in every skirmish.<br/><br/>As an additional benefit,  the Luke Skywalker Ally Pack and the Darth Vader Villain Pack are included within the Imperial Assault Core Set. These figure packs offer sculpted plastic figures alongside additional campaign and skirmish missions that highlight both Luke Skywalker and Darth Vader within Imperial Assault.<br/><br/>With these Imperial Assault and other Figure Packs,  you'll find even more missions that allow your heroes to fight alongside iconic characters from the Star Wars saga. Boxed expansions add more heroes,  imperial and mercenary groups,  and totally new campaigns (see IA Community Wiki for a list),  and the free Star Wars: Imperial Assault \u2013 Legends of the Alliance app provides you with additional content to play in solo or co-op mode.<br/><br/>",

    "Description": "Clans of Caledonia is a mid-to-heavy economic game set in 19th-century Scotland. At this time,  Scotland made the transition from an agricultural to an industrialized country that heavily relied on trade and export. In the following years,  food production increased significantly to feed the population growth. Linen was increasingly substituted by the cheaper cotton and raising sheep was given high importance. More and more distilleries were founded and whisky became the premium alcoholic beverage in Europe.<br/><br/>Players represent historic clans with unique abilities and compete to produce,  trade and export agricultural goods and of course whisky!<br/><br/>The game ends after five rounds. Each round consists of the three phases:<br/><br/>1. Players' turns<br/>2. Production phase<br/>3. Round scoring<br/><br/>1. Players take turns and do one of eight possible actions,  from building,  to upgrading,  trading and exporting. When players run out of money,  they pass and collect a passing bonus.<br/><br/>2. In the production phase,  each player collects basic resources,  refined goods and cash from their production units built on the game map. Each production unit built makes income visible on the player mat. Refined goods require the respective basic resource.<br/><br/>3. Players receive VPs depending on the scoring tile of the current round.<br/><br/>The game comes with eight different clans,  a modular board with 16 configurations,  eight port bonuses and eight round scoring tiles.<br/><br/>",

Three colored cards are placed along the edge of the main board  into 3 x 5 slots,  which are also colored. Ideally players can place cards into slots of the same color. Then they can take both actions and advantages: the action depicted in the slot on the main board and also the advantage of the card. Actions and advantages can allow players to intake raw materials; to build and upgrade city domes,  tunnels and production buildings such as farms,  desalination devices and laboratories in their personal underwater area; to move their marker on the initiative track (which is important for player order in the next turn); to activate the player's &quot;A-cards&quot;; and to collect cards,  both special ones and basic ones that allow for better decision possibilities during gameplay.<br/><br/>All of the nearly 220 cards &mdash; whether special or basic &mdash; are divided into five types according to the way and time of use. Underwater areas are planned to be double-sided,  giving players many opportunities to achieve VPs and finally win.<br/><br/>",

    "Description": "It is the late 26th century. Earth is recovering from a catastrophic explosion that exterminated the majority of the population centuries ago and made most of the surface uninhabitable due to unearthly weather conditions. The surviving humans organized along four radically different ideologies,  called Paths,  to rebuild the world as they see fit: Harmony,  Dominance,  Progress,  and Salvation. Followers of the four Paths live in a fragile peace,  but in almost complete isolation next to each other. Their only meeting point is the last major city on Earth,  now just known as the Capital.<br/><br/>By powering up the mysterious Time Rifts that opened in the wake of the cataclysm,  each Path is able to reach back to specific moments in their past. Doing so can greatly speed up their progress,  but too much meddling may endanger the time-space continuum. But progress is more important than ever before: if the mysterious message arriving through the Time Rift is to be believed,  an even more terrible cataclysm is looming on the horizon: an asteroid bearing the mysterious substance called Neutronium is heading towards Earth. Even stranger,  the scientists show that the energy signature of the asteroid matches the explosion centuries ago...<br/><br/>Anachrony features a unique two-tiered worker placement system. To travel to the Capital or venture out to the devastated areas for resources,  players need not only various specialists (Engineers,  Scientists,  Administrators,  and Geniuses) but also Exosuits to protect and enhance them &mdash; and both are in short supply.<br/><br/>The game is played in 4-7 turns,  depending on the time when the looming cataclysm occurs &mdash; unless,  of course,  it is averted! The elapsed turns are measured on a dynamic timeline. By powering up the Time Rifts,  players can reach back to earlier turns to supply their past &quot;self&quot; with resources. Each Path has a vastly different objective that rewards it with a massive amount of victory points when achieved. The Paths' settlements will survive the impact,  but the Capital will not. Whichever Path manages to collect most points will be the new seat for the Capital,  thus the most important force left on the planet...<br/><br/>",

Building actions allow players to upgrade goods,  sell them or use them to build their own buildings and ships.

Each player attempts to build the best civilization through careful resource management,  discovering new technologies,  electing the right leaders,  building wonders and maintaining a strong military. Weakness in any area can be exploited by your opponents. The game takes place throughout the ages beginning in the age of antiquity and ending in the modern age.<br/><br/>One of the primary mechanisms in TTA is card drafting. Technologies,  wonders,  and leaders come into play and become easier to draft the longer they are in play. In order to use a technology you will need enough science to discover it,  enough food to create a population to man it and enough resources (ore) to build the building to use it. While balancing the resources needed to advance your technology you also need to build a military. Military is built in the same way as civilian buildings. Players that have a weak military will be preyed upon by other players. There is no map in the game so you cannot lose territory,  but players with higher military will steal resources,  science,  kill leaders,  take population or culture. It is very difficult to win with a large military,  but it is very easy to lose because of a weak one.<br/><br/>Victory is achieved by the player whose nation has the most culture at the end of the modern age.<br/><br/>",

    "Description": "Too Many Bones comes loaded for bear by breaking into a new genre: the dice-builder RPG. This game takes everything you think you know about dice-rolling and turns it on its head. Dripping with strategy,  this fantasy-based RPG puts you in the skin of a new race and takes you on an adventure to the northern territories to root out and defeat growing enemy forces and of course the infamous &quot;baddie&quot; responsible.<br/><br/>Team up or go it alone in a 1-4 player Coop or Solo play campaign. With over 100+ unique skill dice and 4-7 classes to choose from,  every battle is its own mini challenge to figure out. Your adventure will consist of 8-12 battles before you reach your final destination and face off against one of a number of possible kingpins in order to win. Along the way,  you will be faced with storyline decisions that will quickly have you weighing risk/reward,  odds,  and logic - with dice woven into every aspect! Your party will also be faced with other decisions: when to rest,  when to explore,  or even which fights to pursue! The Encounter cards offer fun plot twists and some comic relief,  all while setting the stage for your next battle.<br/><br/>",

The king,  awestruck by the interior beauty of the Alhambra,  immediately ordered that his own palace in Portugal be decorated with similar wall tiles. As a tile-laying artist,  you have been challenged to embellish the walls of the Royal Palace of Evora.<br/><br/>In the game Azul,  players take turns drafting colored tiles from suppliers to their player board. Later in the round,  players score points based on how they've placed their tiles to decorate the palace. Extra points are scored for specific patterns and completing sets; wasted supplies harm the player's score. The player with the most points at the end of the game wins.<br/><br/>",

    "Description": "Through the Ages: A New Story of Civilization is the new edition of Through the Ages: A Story of Civilization,  with many changes small and large to the game's cards over its three ages and extensive changes to how military works.<br/><br/>Through the Ages is a civilization building game. Each player attempts to build the best civilization through careful resource management,  discovering new technologies,  electing the right leaders,  building wonders and maintaining a strong military. Weakness in any area can be exploited by your opponents. The game takes place throughout the ages beginning in the age of antiquity and ending in the modern age.<br/><br/>One of the primary mechanisms in TTA is card drafting. Technologies,  wonders,  and leaders come into play and become easier to draft the longer they are in play. In order to use a technology you will need enough science to discover it,  enough food to create a population to man it and enough resources (ore) to build the building to use it. While balancing the resources needed to advance your technology you also need to build a military. Military is built in the same way as civilian buildings. Players that have a weak military will be preyed upon by other players. There is no map in the game so you cannot lose territory,  but players with higher military will steal resources,  science,  kill leaders,  take population or culture. It is very difficult to win with a large military,  but it is very easy to lose because of a weak one.<br/><br/>Victory is achieved by the player whose nation has the most culture at the end of the modern age.<br/><br/>",

We offer fully comprehensive streaming in music and threedee,  news and sitcoms,  classic movies and sensies. We cover it all. Ours is a brave new age,  and as humanity hurtles into space and the future with an astonishing series of new advances every day,  NBN and our affiliates are keeping pace,  bringing you all the vid that's fit to view.<br/><br/>Android: Netrunner is an asymmetrical Living Card Game for two players. Set in the cyberpunk future of Android and Infiltration,  the game pits a megacorporation and its massive resources against the subversive talents of lone runners.<br/><br/>Corporations seek to score agendas by advancing them. Doing so takes time and credits. To buy the time and earn the credits they need,  they must secure their servers and data forts with &quot;ice&quot;. These security programs come in different varieties,  from simple barriers,  to code gates and aggressive sentries. They serve as the corporation's virtual eyes,  ears,  and machine guns on the sprawling information superhighways of the network.<br/><br/>In turn,  runners need to spend their time and credits acquiring a sufficient wealth of resources,  purchasing the necessary hardware,  and developing suitably powerful ice-breaker programs to hack past corporate security measures. Their jobs are always a little desperate,  driven by tight timelines,  and shrouded in mystery. When a runner jacks-in and starts a run at a corporate server,  he risks having his best programs trashed or being caught by a trace program and left vulnerable to corporate countermeasures. It's not uncommon for an unprepared runner to fail to bypass a nasty sentry and suffer massive brain damage as a result. Even if a runner gets through a data fort's defenses,  there's no telling what it holds. Sometimes,  the runner finds something of value. Sometimes,  the best he can do is work to trash whatever the corporation was developing.<br/><br/>The first player to seven points wins the game,  but not likely before he suffers some brain damage or bad publicity.<br/><br/>The Revised Core Set for Android: Netrunner released in late 2017 includes cards from the original Core Set released in 2012 as well as cards from the Genesis Cycle and Spin Cycle series of Data Packs. While the cards in this set have been released previously,  the art on some of them is new.<br/><br/>",

After a long and grueling journey that led through Jerusalem and Mesopotamia and over the &quot;Silk Road&quot;,  they reached the court of Kublai Khan in 1275.<br/><br/>In The Voyages of Marco Polo,  players recreate this journey,  with each player having a different character from history with a special power in the game. The game is played over five rounds. Each round,  the players roll their five personal dice and can perform one action each turn with them. Each action requires the use of one or more dice,  and can be collecting resources or money,  acquiring contracts or traveling on the board. When traveling,  each player begins at Venice and can decide between several routes eastward,  all the way to Beijing. When a player stops at a city,  they place a trading post there,  giving them access to extra actions or resources for the rest of the game. The higher the value of the dice used for an action,  the better the options that may be chosen,  but also the more money the player must pay if an opponent has already chosen the same action.<br/><br/>After five rounds,  the game ends with players receiving extra victory points for having trading posts in Beijing,  fulfilling the most orders,  and having trading posts in the cities on secret city cards that each player gets at the start of the game.<br/><br/>This game should not be confused with Marco Polo Expedition,  which has the same German title.<br/><br/>",

    "Description": "Welcome to Arle<br/>In Fields of Arle,  created by Uwe Rosenberg,  one to two players live as farmers in the small and peaceful town of Arle in East Frisia. The flax grown in the land surrounding the village makes it a profitable place to work and live. Fields of Arle takes players through four and a half years of this era of prosperity,  with different opportunities available as the seasons change. Farm the land to capitalize on the demand for flax,  or find other ways to make the most of the small town&rsquo;s prosperity.<br/><br/>Work the Land<br/>Whether you delve into flax farming or leverage other areas of expertise,  always make sure that you have the land to build up your village. Construct dikes to keep the waters at bay and expand your fields. Dry out bogs to harvest peat and then clear the land for cultivation. Create more fields for your livestock,  buildings,  or future crops; after that,  you can decide whether to house animals or cultivate a forest for timber. Perhaps you&rsquo;d like to take up some flax farming for yourself,  or diversify and try out a little bit of everything.<br/><br/>Tools of the Trade<br/>At the outset of each half year,  you&rsquo;ll choose how you&rsquo;d like to spend that time working. There are many ways to build your fortune. Use the Master space to increase the tools at your disposal,  focus on the Cattle Trainer to make the most of your livestock,  or build up your fleet of vehicles and ship out goods. Taking stock of your progress differs depending on the season. You may milk your existing livestock or care for a bunch of newborn animals. You could harvest your flax in the fall,  and sheer your sheep in spring. At the end of each half year,  you&rsquo;ll need to take stock of your progress by unloading your vehicles and feeding your family and animals,  so keep an eye on the season and do your best to keep the farm growing and everyone well fed!<br/><br/>Travel and Prosper<br/>Once you&rsquo;ve made headway in clearing fields and stocking up goods,  it's time to make your products available to potential buyers. The more vehicles you have,  the more goods you can ship. Send things into the wide world to increase your Travel Experience and grant you points over the course of the four and a half years of the game. Build up your farm and your vehicles and get your goods out into the world to make the most of every season. There are many roads to success in Fields of Arle,  so pick your path,  work the land,  and enjoy the friendly competition as you strive to make your fortune!<br/><br/>- from the publisher's website<br/><br/>",

    "Description": "2018 UPDATE: The second edition of the game is improved for CVD (color blindness) and includes 5 revised cards from the original version and 6 New Worlds promo homeworlds. The promo homeworlds and first edition compatible Revised Cards are both available for purchase through the BGG store.<br/><br/>In the card game Race for the Galaxy,  players build galactic civilizations by playing game cards in front of them that represent worlds or technical and social developments. Some worlds allow players to produce goods,  which can be consumed later to gain either card draws or victory points when the appropriate technologies are available to them. These are mainly provided by the developments and worlds that are not able to produce,  but the fancier production worlds also give these bonuses.<br/><br/>At the beginning of each round,  players each select,  secretly and simultaneously,  one of the seven roles which correspond to the phases in which the round progresses. By selecting a role,  players activate that phase for this round,  giving each player the opportunity to perform that phase's action. For example,  if one player chooses the settle role,  each player has the opportunity to settle one of the planets from their hand. The player who has chosen the role,  however,  gets a bonus that applies only to them. But bonuses may also be acquired through developments,  so you must be aware when another player also takes advantage of your choice of role.<br/><br/>",

    "Description": "You are the leader of one of the 7 great cities of the Ancient World. Gather resources,  develop commercial routes,  and affirm your military supremacy. Build your city and erect an architectural wonder which will transcend future times.<br/><br/>7 Wonders lasts three ages. In each age,  players receive seven cards from a particular deck,  choose one of those cards,  then pass the remainder to an adjacent player. Players reveal their cards simultaneously,  paying resources if needed or collecting resources or interacting with other players in various ways. (Players have individual boards with special powers on which to organize their cards,  and the boards are double-sided). Each player then chooses another card from the deck they were passed,  and the process repeats until players have six cards in play from that age. After three ages,  the game ends.<br/><br/>In essence,  7 Wonders is a card development game. Some cards have immediate effects,  while others provide bonuses or upgrades later in the game. Some cards provide discounts on future purchases. Some provide military strength to overpower your neighbors and others give nothing but victory points. Each card is played immediately after being drafted,  so you'll know which cards your neighbor is receiving and how her choices might affect what you've already built up. Cards are passed left-right-left over the three ages,  so you need to keep an eye on the neighbors in both directions.<br/><br/>Though the box of earlier editions is listed as being for 3&ndash;7 players,  there is an official 2-player variant included in the instructions.<br/><br/>",

Is it the work of Vermlings,  or is something far more sinister going on?<br/><br/>Gloomhaven: Jaws of the Lion is aimed at a more casual audience to get people into the gameplay more quickly. All of the hard-to-organize cardboard map tiles have been removed,  and instead players will play on the scenario book itself,  which features new artwork unique to each scenario.

    "Description": "In the dystopic 1930s,  the industrial revolution pushed the exploitation of fossil-based resources to the limit,  and now the only thing powerful enough to quench the thirst for power of the massive machines and of the unstoppable engineering progress is the unlimited hydroelectric energy provided by the rivers.<br/><br/>Barrage is a resource management strategic game in which players compete to build their majestic dams,  raise them to increase their storing capacity,  and deliver all the potential power through pressure tunnels connected to the energy turbines of their powerhouses.<br/><br/>Each player represents one of the four international companies who are gathering machinery,  innovative patents and brilliant engineers to claim the best locations to collect and exploit the water of a contested Alpine region crossed by rivers.<br/><br/>Barrage includes two innovative and challenging mechanisms. First,  the players must carefully plan their actions and handle their machinery,  since both their action tokens and resources are stored on a Construction Wheel and will only be available after a full turn of the wheel. The better you manage your wheel,  the earlier your resources and actions come back to you.<br/><br/>Second,  the water flow on the rivers depicted on the board is a shared and contested resource. Players have to intercept and store as much of the water as they can,  build dams (upstream dams are expensive but can block part of the water before it reaches the downstream dams),  raise the dams to increase their capacity,  and build long tunnels to channel the water to their powerhouses. Water is never consumed &mdash; its flow is just used to produce energy &mdash;,  it is instead released back to the rivers,  so you have to strategically place your dams to recover the water diverted by you and the other players.<br/><br/>Over five rounds,  the players must fulfill power requirements represented by a common competitive power track and meet specific requests of personal contracts. At the same time,  by placing a limited number of engineers,  they attempt to enhance their machinery to acquire new and more efficient construction actions and to build and activate special unique-effect buildings to forward their own developing strategy.<br/><br/>",

    "Description": "90, 000 B.C. &mdash; A great ice age is fast approaching. Another titanic struggle for global supremacy has unwittingly commenced between the varying animal species. <br/>Dominant Species is a game that abstractly recreates a tiny portion of ancient history: the ponderous encroachment of an ice age and what that entails for the living creatures trying to adapt to the slowly-changing earth. <br/>Each player will assume the role of one of six major animal classes&mdash;mammal,  reptile,  bird,  amphibian,  arachnid,  or insect. Each begins the game more or less in a state of natural balance in relation to one another. But that won&rsquo;t last: It is indeed &quot;survival of the fittest&quot;.<br/>Through wily action pawn placement,  players will strive to become dominant on as many different terrain tiles as possible in order to claim powerful card effects. Players will also want to propagate their individual species in order to earn victory points for their particular animal. Players will be aided in these endeavors via speciation,  migration,  and adaptation actions,  among others. <br/>All of this eventually leads to the end game&mdash;the final ascent of the ice age&mdash;where the player having accumulated the most victory points will have his animal crowned the Dominant Species. <br/>But somebody better become dominant quickly,  because it&rsquo;s getting mighty cold...<br/><br/>Game Play<br/>The large hexagonal tiles are used throughout the game to create an ever-expanding interpretation of earth as it might have appeared a thousand centuries ago. The smaller tundra tiles will be placed atop the larger tiles&mdash;converting them into tundra in the process&mdash;as the ice age encroaches.<br/>The cylindrical action pawns (or &quot;AP&quot;s) drive the game. Each AP will allow a player to perform the various actions that can be taken,  such as speciation,  environmental change,  migration,  or glaciation. After being placed on the action display during the Planning Phase,  an AP will trigger that particular action for the owning player during the Execution Phase.<br/>Generally,  players will be trying to enhance their own animal&rsquo;s survivability while simultaneously trying to hinder that of their opponents&rsquo;&mdash;hopefully collecting valuable victory points (or &quot;VP&quot;s) along the way. The various cards will aid in these efforts,  giving players useful one-time abilities or an opportunity for recurring VP gains.<br/>Throughout the game,  species cubes will be added to,  moved about in,  and removed from the tiles in play (the &quot;earth&quot;). Element disks will be added to and removed from both animals and earth. <br/>When the game ends,  players will conduct a final scoring of each tile&mdash;after which the player controlling the animal with the highest VP total wins.<br/><br/>",

    "Description": "Crossing into the Land of 1001 Nights,  your caravan arrives at the fabled Sultanate of Naqala. The old sultan just died and control of Naqala is up for grabs! The oracles foretold of strangers who would maneuver the Five Tribes to gain influence over the legendary city-state. Will you fulfill the prophecy? Invoke the old Djinns and move the Tribes into position at the right time,  and the Sultanate may become yours!<br/><br/>Designed by Bruno Cathala,  Five Tribes builds on a long tradition of German-style games that feature wooden meeples. Here,  in a unique twist on the now-standard &quot;worker placement&quot; genre,  the game begins with the meeples already in place &ndash; and players must cleverly maneuver them over the villages,  markets,  oases,  and sacred places tiles that make up Naqala. How,  when,  and where you dis-place these Five Tribes of Assassins,  Elders,  Builders,  Merchants,  and Viziers determine your victory or failure.<br/><br/>As befitting a Days of Wonder game,  the rules are straightforward and easy to learn. But devising a winning strategy will take a more calculated approach than our standard fare. You need to carefully consider what moves can score you well and put your opponents at a disadvantage. You need to weigh many different pathways to victory,  including the summoning of powerful Djinns that may help your cause as you attempt to control this legendary Sultanate.<br/><br/>",

During each round,  they simultaneously draw chips from their bags and add them to their pots. The higher the face value of the drawn chip,  the further it is placed in the pot's swirling pattern,  increasing how much the potion will be worth. Push your luck as far as you can,  but if you add too many cherry bombs,  your pot will explode!<br/><br/>At the end of each round,  players gain victory points and coins to spend on new ingredients,  depending on how well they managed to fill up their pots.

    "Description": "Lisboa is a game about the reconstruction of Lisboa after the great earthquake of 1755.<br/><br/>On November 1,  1755,  Lisbon suffered an earthquake of an estimated magnitude of 8.5&ndash;9.0,  followed by a tsunami and three days of fires. The city was almost totally destroyed. The Marques of Pombal &mdash; Sebasti&atilde;o Jos&eacute; de Carvalho e Melo &mdash; was the then Minister of Foreign Affairs and the King put him in charge of the reconstruction of Lisbon. The Marques of Pombal gathered a team of engineers and architects and you,  the players,  are members of the nobility; members who will use your influence in the reconstruction and business development of the new city. You will work with the architects to build Lisbon anew,  with the Marquis to develop commerce and with the King to open all the buildings,  but the true reason you do all this is not for greatness or fame or even fortune,  but for the most important thing of all in that time: wigs.<br/><br/>Lisboa is played on a real map of downtown Lisbon. During the planning of the downtown project,  the type of business permitted in each street was previously determined. The economic motor is driven by the wealth of the royal treasure and this treasure is controlled by player actions during the game,  making each game a totally different experience. The game ends after a fixed number of rounds and whoever gathers the most wigs by the end of the game wins.<br/><br/>Lisboa is played in rounds. Each round,  all players play one turn. They may place one card on their display or replace one card from this display. During the game,  players schedule hearings to get character favors,  such as commerce,  construction,  and openings. The iconic buildings score the stores and stores provide income to the players. Players need to manage influence,  construction licenses,  store permits,  church power,  workers and money,  with the workers' cost being dependent on the prestige of the players.<br/><br/>",

    "Description": "Following the success of unmanned rover missions,  the United Nations established the Department of Operations and Mars Exploration (D.O.M.E.). The first settlers arrived on Mars in the year 2037 and in the decades after establishment Mars Base Camp,  private exploration companies began work on the creation of a self-sustaining colony. As chief astronaut for one of these enterprises,  you want to be a pioneer in the development of the biggest,  most advanced colony on Mars by achieving both D.O.M.E. mission goals as well as your company&rsquo;s private agenda.<br/><br/>In the beginning,  you will be dependent on supplies from Earth and will have to travel often between the Mars Space Station and the planet's surface. As the colony expands over time,  you will shift your activities to construct mines,  power generators,  water extractors,  greenhouses,  oxygen factories,  and shelters. Your goal is to develop a self-sustaining colony independent of any terrestrial organization. This will require understanding the importance of water,  air,  power,  and food &mdash; the necessities for survival.<br/><br/>Do you dare take part in humankind&rsquo;s biggest challenge?<br/><br/>On Mars is played over several rounds,  each consisting of two phases - the Colonization Phase \u200band the Shuttle Phase\u200b.<br/><br/>During the Colonization Phase,  each player takes a turn during which they take actions. The available actions depend on the side of the board they are on. If you are in orbit,  you can take blueprints,  buy and develop technologies,  and take supplies from the Warehouse. If you are on the surface of the planet,  you can construct buildings with your bots,  upgrade these buildings using blueprints,  take scientists and new contracts,  welcome new ships,  and explore the planet&rsquo;s surface with your rover. In the Shuttle Phase,  players may travel between the colony and the Space Station in orbit.<br/><br/>All buildings on Mars have a dependency on each other and some are required for the colony to grow. Building shelters for Colonists to live in requires oxygen; generating oxygen requires plants; growing plants requires water; extracting water from ice requires power; generating power requires mining minerals; and mining minerals requires Colonists. Upgrading the colony&rsquo;s ability to provide each of these resources is vital. As the colony grows,  more shelters are needed so that the Colonists can survive the inhospitable conditions on Mars.<br/><br/>During the game,  players are also trying to complete missions. Once a total of three missions have been completed,  the game ends. To win the game,  players must contribute to the development of the first colony on Mars. This is represented during the game by players gaining Opportunity Points (OP). The player with the most OP at the end of the game is declared the winner.<br/><br/>",

    "Description": "Keyflower is a game for two to six players played over four rounds. Each round represents a season: spring,  summer,  autumn,  and finally winter. Each player starts the game with a &quot;home&quot; tile and an initial team of eight workers,  each of which is colored red,  yellow,  or blue. Workers of matching colors are used by the players to bid for tiles to add to their villages. Matching workers may alternatively be used to generate resources,  skills and additional workers,  not only from the player's own tiles,  but also from the tiles in the other players' villages and from the new tiles being auctioned.<br/><br/>In spring,  summer and autumn,  more workers will arrive on board the Keyflower and her sister boats,  with some of these workers possessing skills in the working of the key resources of iron,  stone and wood. In each of these seasons,  village tiles are set out at random for auction. In the winter no new workers arrive and the players select the village tiles for auction from those they received at the beginning of the game. Each winter village tile offers VPs for certain combinations of resources,  skills and workers. The player whose village and workers generate the most VPs wins the game.<br/><br/>Keyflower presents players with many different challenges and each game will be different due to the mix of village tiles that appear in that particular game. Throughout the game,  players will need to be alert to the opportunities to best utilize their various resources,  transport and upgrade capability,  skills and workers.<br/><br/>Keyflower,  a joint design between Richard Breese and Sebastian Bleasdale,  is the seventh game in the &quot;Key&quot; series from R&amp;D Games set in the medieval &quot;Key&quot; land.<br/><br/>",

    "Description": "Paladins of the West Kingdom is set at a turbulent time of West Francia's story,  circa 900 AD. Despite recent efforts to develop the city,  outlying townships are still under threat from outsiders. Saracens scout the borders,  while Vikings plunder wealth and livestock. Even the Byzantines from the east have shown their darker side. As noble men and women,  players must gather workers from the city to defend against enemies,  build fortifications and spread faith throughout the land. Fortunately you are not alone. In his great wisdom,  the King has sent his finest knights to help aid in our efforts. So ready the horses and sharpen the swords. The Paladins are approaching.<br/><br/>The aim of Paladins of the West Kingdom is to be the player with the most victory points (VP) at game's end. Points are gained by building outposts and fortifications,  commissioning monks and confronting outsiders. Each round,  players will enlist the help of a specific Paladin and gather workers to carry out tasks. As the game progresses,  players will slowly increase their faith,  strength and influence. Not only will these affect their final score,  but they will also determine the significance of their actions. The game is concluded at the end of the seventh round.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

    "Description": "Once upon a time ...<br/>1289. To strengthen the borders of the Kingdom of France,  King Philip the Fair decided to have a new castle built. For the time being,  Caylus is but a humble village,  but soon,  workers and craftsmen will be flocking by the cartload,  attracted by the great prospects. Around the building site,  a city is slowly rising up.<br/><br/>The players embody master builders. By building the King's castle and developing the city around it,  they earn prestige points and gain the King's favor. When the castle is finished,  the player who has earned the most prestige wins the game.  The expansion Caylus Expansion: The Jeweller was included in the 2nd Edition.<br/><br/>Each turn,  players pay to place their workers in various buildings in the village. These buildings allow players to gather resources or money,  or to build or upgrade buildings with those resources. Players can also use their resources to help build the castle itself,  earning points and favors from the king,  which provide larger bonuses. Building a building provides some immediate points,  and potentially income throughout the game,  since players receive bonuses when others use their buildings. The buildings chosen by the players have a heavy impact on the course of the game,  since they determine the actions that will be available to all the players.<br/><br/>As new buildings are built,  they stretch along a road stretching away from the castle,  and not all buildings can be used every turn. Players have some control over which buildings are active by paying to influence the movement of the Provost marker. The final position of the marker is the newest building that can be used that turn. The Provost marker also helps determine the movement of the Bailiff marker,  which determines the end of the game. Generally,  if players are building many buildings and the Provost is generous in allowing them to be used,  the game ends more quickly.<br/><br/>",

    "Description": "Tainted Grail: the Fall of Avalon  is an unforgettable,  solo or cooperative adventure experience for 1-4 players. Blending Arthurian legends and Celtic mythology with a unique vision,  it allows you to impact the game world in deep and meaningful ways. A deep,  branching storyline allows you to tackle problems in different ways,  ensuring no two games play alike. Difficult decisions or harrowing choices wait behind every corner and seemingly minor tasks may reverberate with major long-term consequences.<br/><br/>In a land slowly sinking into the Wyrdness and torn apart by con\ufb02ict; surviving each day is a challenge on its own. Starvation,  sickness,  violent weather,  and random incidents all conspire to end your journey. Guardian Menhirs,  that ensured safe travel throughout the realm,  are slowly going dark turning simple logistics into an involving puzzle. To overcome these challenges,  your character develops along several con\ufb02icting lines,  such as Brutality / Empathy or Practicality / Spirituality. These traits unlock a rich choice of mutually exclusive skills and lead to di\ufb00erent deck-building strategies,  making character advancement meaningful and deep.<br/><br/>The character you develop is going to be tested during dozens of combat and non-combat encounters. Sometimes you will need to brute force your way,  but often diplomacy might be a better option. Regardless whether you fight with your strength or your wits,  our unique dice-less encounter system makes resolving each con\ufb02ict fun and exciting,  while keeping you immersed in the game.<br/><br/>In Avalon,  there&rsquo;s a legend waiting behind every stone and every tree. All locations have their own rich stories and secrets to discover. Places and characters are often much more than they seem. As you slowly put all the pieces of the larger puzzle together,  the land will always have a surprise waiting for you just around the corner. Many secrets can be discovered only after several games. Created by one of the best polish fantasy authors,  Krzysztof Piskorski,  the story of Tainted Grail: the Fall of Avalon aims to push the boundaries of non-linear narrative,  building upon the rich experience Awaken Realms has infusing ambitious stories with excellent board game mechanics and striking visuals.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

    "Description": "In this award-winning game,  players take on the roles of Grandes in medieval Spain.  The king's power is flagging,  and these powerful lords are vying for control of the various regions.  To that end,  you draft caballeros (knights in the form of colored cubes) into your court and subsequently move them onto the board to help seize control of regions.  After every third round,  the regions are scored,  and after the ninth round,  the player with the most points is the winner.<br/><br/>In each of the nine rounds,  you select one of your 13 power cards to determine turn order as well as the number of caballeros you get to move from the provinces (general supply) into your court (personal supply).<br/><br/>A turn then consists of selecting one of five action cards which allow variations to the rules and additional scoring opportunities in addition to determining how many caballeros to move from your court to one or more of the regions on the board (or into the castillo - a secretive tower). Normally,  you may only place your caballeros into regions adjacent to the one containing the king pawn. The one hard and fast rule in El Grande is that nothing may move into or out of the king's region. One of the five action cards that is always available each round allows you to move the king to a new region. The other four action cards varying from round to round.<br/><br/>The goal is to have a caballero majority in as many regions (and the castillo) as possible during a scoring round. Following the scoring of the castillo,  you place any cubes you had stashed there into the region you had secretly indicated on your region dial. Each region is then scored individually according to a table printed in that region. Two-point bonuses are awarded for having sole majority in the region containing your Grande (large cube) and in the region containing the king.<br/><br/>",

    "Description": "In Pax Pamir,  players assume the role of nineteenth century Afghan leaders attempting to forge a new state after the collapse of the Durrani Empire. Western histories often call this period &quot;The Great Game&quot; because of the role played by the Europeans who attempted to use central Asia as a theater for their own rivalries. In this game,  those empires are viewed strictly from the perspective of the Afghans who sought to manipulate the interloping ferengi (foreigners) for their own purposes.<br/><br/>In terms of game play,  Pax Pamir is a pretty straightforward tableau builder. Players spend most of their turns purchasing cards from a central market,  then playing those cards in front of them in a single row called a court. Playing cards adds units to the game's map and grants access to additional actions that can be taken to disrupt other players and influence the course of the game. That last point is worth emphasizing. Though everyone is building their own row of cards,  the game offers many ways for players to interfere with each other directly and indirectly.<br/><br/>To survive,  players will organize into coalitions. Throughout the game,  the dominance of the different coalitions will be evaluated by the players when a special card,  called a &quot;Dominance Check&quot;,  is resolved. If a single coalition has a commanding lead during one of these checks,  those players loyal to that coalition will receive victory points based on their influence in their coalition. However,  if Afghanistan remains fragmented during one of these checks,  players instead will receive victory points based on their personal power base.<br/><br/>After each Dominance Check,  victory is checked and the game will be partially reset,  offering players a fresh attempt to realize their ambitions. The game ends when a single player is able to achieve a lead of four or more victory points  or after the fourth and final Dominance Check is resolved.<br/><br/>",

    "Description": "Twilight Imperium Third Edition is an epic empire-building game of interstellar conflict,  trade,  and struggle for power. Players take the roles of ancient galactic civilizations,  each seeking to seize the imperial throne via warfare,  diplomacy,  and technological progression. With geomorphic board tiles,  exquisite plastic miniatures,  hundreds of cards,  and introducing a rich set of strategic dimensions that allows each player to refocus their game-plan,  the original designer (Christian T. Petersen) has seamlessly incorporated the better qualities of other recently popular games to improve on the game-play of the original TI,  making it at once perfectly well-rounded and pleasantly familiar to experienced gamers.<br/><br/>TI3 is played by at least three players who belong to ten possible alien races,  each with their own advantages and quirks. The 'designer notes' in the rulebook candidly and humbly acknowledge the inspiration for some of the improvements to the original game. The strategic game-play borrows the governing element from Puerto Rico to involve players in an iteratively complex and yet fast-paced game experience with very little downtime. The game map,  basic player progress and overall victory are dynamically determined in almost exactly the same way as they are by imaginative players of Catan,  while the &quot;Command&quot; system cleverly improves on the 'oil' logistical mechanism of Attack! to both manage turn-based activity and limit the size of armies,  uniquely enabling weakened players to bounce back if they play their cards right.<br/><br/>Part of the Twilight Imperium Series.<br/><br/>Re-implements:<br/><br/>    Twilight Imperium: Second Edition<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Expanded by:<br/><br/>    Twilight Imperium: Third Edition \u2013 Shattered Empire<br/>    Twilight Imperium: Third Edition \u2013 Shards of the Throne<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Re-implemented in:<br/><br/>    Twilight Imperium: Fourth Edition<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>",

    "Description": "Star Wars: Rebellion is a board game of epic conflict between the Galactic Empire and Rebel Alliance for two to four players.<br/><br/>Experience the Galactic Civil War like never before. In Rebellion,  you control the entire Galactic Empire or the fledgling Rebel Alliance. You must command starships,  account for troop movements,  and rally systems to your cause. Given the differences between the Empire and Rebel Alliance,  each side has different win conditions,  and you'll need to adjust your play style depending on who you represent:<br/><br/>     As the Imperial player,  you can command legions of Stormtroopers,  swarms of TIEs,  Star Destroyers,  and even the Death Star. You rule the galaxy by fear,  relying on the power of your massive military to enforce your will. To win the game,  you need to snuff out the budding Rebel Alliance by finding its base and obliterating it. Along the way,  you can subjugate worlds or even destroy them.<br/>     As the Rebel player,  you can command dozens of troopers,  T-47 airspeeders,  Corellian corvettes,  and fighter squadrons. However,  these forces are no match for the Imperial military. In terms of raw strength,  you'll find yourself clearly overmatched from the very outset,  so you'll need to rally the planets to join your cause and execute targeted military strikes to sabotage Imperial build yards and steal valuable intelligence. To win the Galactic Civil War,  you'll need to sway the galaxy's citizens to your cause. If you survive long enough and strengthen your reputation,  you inspire the galaxy to a full-scale revolt,  and you win.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Featuring more than 150 plastic miniatures and two game boards that account for thirty-two of the Star Wars galaxy's most notable systems,  Rebellion features a scope that is as large and sweeping as any Star Wars game before it.<br/><br/>Yet for all its grandiosity,  Rebellion remains intensely personal,  cinematic,  and heroic. As much as your success depends upon the strength of your starships,  vehicles,  and troops,  it depends upon the individual efforts of such notable characters as Leia Organa,  Mon Mothma,  Grand Moff Tarkin,  and Emperor Palpatine. As civil war spreads throughout the galaxy,  these leaders are invaluable to your efforts,  and the secret missions they attempt will evoke many of the most inspiring moments from the classic trilogy. You might send Luke Skywalker to receive Jedi training on Dagobah or have Darth Vader spring a trap that freezes Han Solo in carbonite!<br/><br/>",

    "Description": "Battlestar Galactica: The Board Game is an exciting game of mistrust,  intrigue,  and the struggle for survival. Based on the epic and widely-acclaimed Sci Fi Channel series,  Battlestar Galactica: The Board Game puts players in the role of one of ten of their favorite characters from the show. Each playable character has their own abilities and weaknesses,  and must all work together in order for humanity to have any hope of survival. However,  one or more players in every game secretly side with the Cylons. Players must attempt to expose the traitor while fuel shortages,  food contaminations,  and political unrest threatens to tear the fleet apart.<br/><br/>After the Cylon attack on the Colonies,  the battered remnants of the human race are on the run,  constantly searching for the next signpost on the road to Earth. They face the threat of Cylon attack from without,  and treachery and crisis from within. Humanity must work together if they are to have any hope of survival&hellip;but how can they,  when any of them may,  in fact,  be a Cylon agent?<br/><br/>Battlestar Galactica: The Board Game is a semi-cooperative game for 3-6 players ages 10 and up that can be played in 2-3 hours. Players choose from pilots,  political leaders,  military leaders,  or engineers to crew Galactica. They are also dealt a loyalty card at the start of the game to determine if they are a human or Cylon along with an assortment of skill cards based on their characters abilities. Players then can move and take actions either on Galactica,  on Colonial 1,  or in a Viper. They need to collect skill cards,  fend off Cylon ships,  and keep Galactica and the fleet jumping. Each turn also brings a Crisis Card,  various tasks that players must overcome. Players need to play matching skill cards to fend off the problems; skill cards that don't match hinder the players success. Fate could be working against the crew,  or there could be a traitorous Cylon! As players get closer and closer towards reaching their Earth,  another round of loyalty cards are passed out and more Cylons may turn up. If players can keep their up their food stores,  fuel levels,  ship morale,  and population,  and they can keep Galactica in one piece long enough to make it to Earth,  the Humans win the game. But if the Cylon players reveal themselves at the right moment and bring down Galactica,  the Humans have lost.<br/><br/>Official Site,  Rules &amp; FAQ: <a target='_blank' href=\"http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/edge_minisite_sec.asp?eidm=18&amp\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/edge_minisite_sec.asp?eidm...</a>;esem=4<br/>Unofficial FAQ for really tricky questions: <a target='_blank' href=\"http://boardgamegeek.com/wiki/page/Battlestar_Galactica_FAQ\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">http://boardgamegeek.com/wiki/page/Battlestar_Galactica_FAQ</a><br/><br/>",

    "Description": "Across the globe,  ancient evil is stirring. Now,  you and your trusted circle of colleagues must travel around the world,  working against all odds to hold back the approaching horror. Foul monsters,  brutal encounters,  and obscure mysteries will take you to your limit and beyond. All the while,  you and your fellow investigators must unravel the otherworldy mysteries scattered around the globe in order to push back the gathering mayhem that threatens to overwhelm humanity. The end draws near! Do you have the courage to prevent global destruction?<br/><br/>Eldritch Horror is a co-operative game of terror and adventure in which one to eight players take the roles of globetrotting investigators working to solve mysteries,  gather clues,  and protect the world from an Ancient One &ndash; that is,  an elder being intent on destroying our world. Each Ancient One comes with its own unique decks of Mystery and Research cards,  which draw you deeper into the lore surrounding each loathsome creature. Discover the true name of Azathoth or battle Cthulhu on the high seas.<br/><br/>While the tasks on these Mystery cards (along with the locations of otherworldly gates,  menacing monsters,  and helpful clues) will often inform both your travel plans and the dangers you confront,  you can find adventure anywhere in the world...even where you least expect it. It is during the Encounter Phase of each turn that players resolve combat or,  alternatively,  build their investigators' personal stories by reading an encounter narrative from one of several types of Encounter cards. You might go head to head with a monster in Istanbul or find yourself in a tough spot with the crime syndicate in a major city. Maybe you will embark on an expedition to the Pyramids or research a clue you uncover in the unnamed wilderness. You may even find your way through a gate and explore a dimension beyond time and space.<br/><br/>Should you fail an encounter,  the cost is steep. If you are fortunate,  you will merely incur physical or mental trauma. However,  you might also be compelled to take a Condition card,  which represents a specific injury or restriction gained throughout your journey,  such as a Leg Injury or Amnesia. You could find yourself getting in over your head to acquire assets and receive a Debt condition &ndash; or maybe you'll owe a favor to something far more insidious than a debt collector,  and enter into a Dark Pact! Whatever your condition,  you would be wise to find a resolution with haste; many conditions have a &quot;reckoning effect&quot; which,  if triggered,  ensure a much more sinister fate.<br/><br/>All the while,  the arrival of the Ancient One approaches. Its malign influence is manifested in Eldritch Horror as you draw Mythos Cards,  which govern the appearance of otherworldly gates,  fearsome monsters,  and other ominous elements. Mythos cards keep your investigators under pressure,  introducing new threats,  even as the arrival of the Great Old One draws nearer! Since the investigators draw a new Mythos card each round,  they're certain to have their hands full battling foul creatures and following up on strange rumors,  even as they work to solve their three all-important mysteries.<br/><br/>With twelve unique investigators,  two hundred-fifty tokens,  and over three hundred cards,  Eldritch Horror presents an epic,  world-spanning adventure with each and every game.<br/><br/>",

Inspiring artists,  important politicians,  and tourists from all over the world are populating Vienna and in need of a hotel room. This is your opportunity to turn your little caf&eacute; into a world famous hotel. Hire staff,  fulfill the wishes of your guests,  and gain the emperor's favor. Only then will your caf&eacute; become the Grand Austria Hotel.<br/><br/>The start player rolls the dice,  sorting them by the rolled number and placing them on the corresponding action spaces. On a turn,  a player chooses one of the six actions and carries it out. The number of the available dice in the corresponding action spaces determines how much the player gets from the action. They then remove one of the dice and can carry out additional actions. With the different actions,  a player can get the necessary drinks and dishes,  prepare the rooms,  or hire staff.<br/><br/>But no hotel can grow without guests. To choose wisely which guests to attract and to complete their orders brings some important bonus actions. The staff cards also have different advantages,  but the game ends after seven rounds and no player can do everything they want,  so whoever makes the right decisions and finds the best way to create bonus actions will win.<br/><br/>With 116 different cards and a new set-up in each game,  Grand Austria Hotel provides a huge replay value. Each game stands on its own and demands new tactics and strategies.<br/><br/>",

    "Description": "In Patchwork,  two players compete to build the most aesthetic (and high-scoring) patchwork quilt on a personal 9x9 game board. To start play,  lay out all of the patches at random in a circle and place a marker directly clockwise of the 2-1 patch. Each player takes five buttons &mdash; the currency/points in the game &mdash; and someone is chosen as the start player.<br/><br/>On a turn,  a player either purchases one of the three patches standing clockwise of the spool or passes. To purchase a patch,  you pay the cost in buttons shown on the patch,  move the spool to that patch's location in the circle,  add the patch to your game board,  then advance your time token on the time track a number of spaces equal to the time shown on the patch. You're free to place the patch anywhere on your board that doesn't overlap other patches,  but you probably want to fit things together as tightly as possible. If your time token is behind or on top of the other player's time token,  then you take another turn; otherwise the opponent now goes. Instead of purchasing a patch,  you can choose to pass; to do this,  you move your time token to the space immediately in front of the opponent's time token,  then take one button from the bank for each space you moved.<br/><br/>In addition to a button cost and time cost,  each patch also features 0-3 buttons,  and when you move your time token past a button on the time track,  you earn &quot;button income&quot;: sum the number of buttons depicted on your personal game board,  then take this many buttons from the bank.<br/><br/>What's more,  the time track depicts five 1x1 patches on it,  and during set-up you place five actual 1x1 patches on these spaces. Whoever first passes a patch on the time track claims this patch and immediately places it on his game board.<br/><br/>Additionally,  the first player to completely fill in a 7x7 square on his game board earns a bonus tile worth 7 extra points at the end of the game. (Of course,  this doesn't happen in every game.)<br/><br/>When a player takes an action that moves his time token to the central square of the time track,  he takes one final button income from the bank. Once both players are in the center,  the game ends and scoring takes place. Each player scores one point per button in his possession,  then loses two points for each empty square on his game board. Scores can be negative. The player with the most points wins.<br/><br/>",

    "Description": "In Russian Railroads,  players compete in an exciting race to build the largest and most advanced railway network. In order to do so,  the players appoint their workers to various important tasks.<br/><br/>The development of simple tracks will quickly bring the players to important places,  while the modernization of their railway network will improve the efficiency of their machinery. Newer locomotives cover greater distances and factories churn out improved technology. Engineers,  when used effectively,  can be the extra boost that an empire needs to race past the competition.<br/><br/>There are many paths to victory: Who will ride into the future full steam ahead and who will be run off the rails? Whose empire will overcome the challenges ahead and emerge victorious?<br/><br/><br/>Game Summary<br/>Each player has their own board,  with space for factories,  and 3 rail tracks (to 3 different cities). On each track,  use a track token to mark the progression of your rails (different colored marker for each type or rail). Some interesting twists:<br/>- The different track types must be built in a specific order (black,  gray,  brown,  natural,  white). Later tracks may never be advanced further on the track than the earlier tracks.<br/>- On each track,  as the track head advances,  you cross several thresholds that provide awards: the ability to start a new color of track,  victory points,  bonus tiles,  etc.<br/>- Each track line can have one (two for the first rail) engine(s) associated with it; the size of the loco(s) determines how far down the track you actually score VP.<br/><br/>The central board has (almost) all the locations for placing workers. Each location requires 1-3 workers (of one player; played all together). Players,  who start the game with 5 workers (or 6 workers,  in 2-3 player games),  will take turns using a location. These provide a variety of abilities,  for example:<br/>- advance 1 or more track heads by 1-3 spaces<br/>- acquire an engine or factory; engines are allocated to rail lines,  while factories (the reverse side of the tile) are placed on your factory line.<br/>- earn 2 coins<br/>- take 2 temporary workers<br/>- jump ahead in turn order<br/>- acquire an engineer,  which has a unique power and becomes a worker-placement location only for you<br/><br/>Each round ends when all players have passed on placing/using workers. Then,  score VP for each track and factory line. On each track line,  only spaces as far down the track as the loco level will score. Each track type scores VP for every space from its track head back to where the next color of track starts. Track types built earlier (e.g. black) score less/space than later tracks (e.g.,  white). On each factory line the position of the purple industry marker(s) show how many VP are scored.<br/><br/>After 7 rounds (or 6 rounds,  in 2-3 player games),  the game ends; most VP wins!<br/><br/>",

    "Description": "Raiders of the North Sea is set in the central years of the Viking Age. As Viking warriors,  players seek to impress the Chieftain by raiding unsuspecting settlements. To do so,  players need to assemble a crew,  collect provisions,  and journey north to plunder gold,  iron and livestock. Glory can be found in battle,  even at the hands of the Valkyrie,  so gather your warriors because it's raiding season!<br/><br/>To impress the Chieftain,  you need victory points (VPs),  with those being acquired primarily by raiding settlements,  taking plunder,  and making offerings to the Chieftain. How you use your plunder is also vital to your success. Players take turns in clockwise order,  and on a turn you place a worker and resolve its action,  then pick up a different worker and resolve its action. Broadly speaking,  those actions fall in one of two categories:<br/><br/><br/>     Work: Having a good crew and enough provisions are vital to successful raiding,  so before making any raids,  players need to do some work to prepare their crew and collect supplies. This is all done in the village at the bottom of the game board,  with eight buildings offering various actions. You must first place your worker in an available building where no other worker is present,  then pick up a different worker from a different building.<br/><br/><br/><br/>     Raid: Once players have hired enough crew and collected provisions,  you may choose to raid on your turn. To raid a settlement &mdash; whether a harbor,  outpost,  monastery or fortress &mdash; you need to meet three requirements: Having a large enough crew,  having enough provisions (along with gold for monasteries and fortresses,  and having a worker of the right color. Raiding offers various ways of scoring,  such as military strength,  plunder,  and Valkyries,  which is how grey and white workers enter the game.<br/><br/><br/>The game ends when only one fortress raid remains,  all Valkyrie have been removed,  or all offerings have been made,  then players tally their scores.<br/><br/>",

    "Description": "&quot;Now the trumpet summons us again,  not as a call to bear arms,  though arms we need; not as a call to battle,  though embattled we are &ndash; but a call to bear the burden of a long twilight struggle...&quot;<br/>&ndash; John F. Kennedy<br/><br/>In 1945,  unlikely allies toppled Hitler's war machine,  while humanity's most devastating weapons forced the Japanese Empire to its knees in a storm of fire. Where once there stood many great powers,  there then stood only two. The world had scant months to sigh its collective relief before a new conflict threatened. Unlike the titanic struggles of the preceding decades,  this conflict would be waged not primarily by soldiers and tanks,  but by spies and politicians,  scientists and intellectuals,  artists and traitors. Twilight Struggle is a two-player game simulating the forty-five year  dance of intrigue,  prestige,  and occasional flares of warfare between the Soviet Union and the United States. The entire world is the stage on which these two titans fight to make the world safe for their own ideologies and ways of life. The game begins amidst the ruins of Europe as the two new &quot;superpowers&quot; scramble over the wreckage of the Second World War,  and ends in 1989,  when only the United States remained standing.<br/><br/>Twilight Struggle inherits its fundamental systems from the card-driven classics We the People and Hannibal: Rome vs. Carthage. It is a quick-playing,  low-complexity game in that tradition. The game map is a world map of the period,  whereon players move units and exert influence in attempts to gain allies and control for their superpower. As with GMT's other card-driven games,  decision-making is a challenge; how to best use one's cards and units given consistently limited resources?<br/><br/>Twilight Struggle's Event cards add detail and flavor to the game. They cover a vast array of historical happenings,  from the Arab-Israeli conflicts of 1948 and 1967,  to Vietnam and the U.S. peace movement,  to the Cuban Missile Crisis and other such incidents that brought the world to the brink of nuclear annihilation. Subsystems capture the prestige-laden Space Race as well as nuclear tensions,  with the possibility of game-ending nuclear war.<br/><br/>Components (original edition):<br/><br/><br/>     228 full colour counters <br/>     22&quot;x34&quot; full colour map <br/>     103 event cards <br/>     2 six-sided dice<br/>     1 24-page rulebook<br/>     2 full colour player aid cards<br/><br/><br/>Components (2009 Deluxe edition and after)<br/><br/>     260 full colour counters <br/>     22&quot;x34&quot; mounted map with revised graphics<br/>     110 event cards<br/>     2 six-sided dice<br/>     1 24-page rulebook<br/>     2 full colour player aid cards<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>TIME SCALE:     approx. 3-5 years per turn<br/>MAP SCALE:     Point-to-point system<br/>UNIT SCALE:     Influence markers<br/>NUMBER OF PLAYERS:     2<br/><br/>DESIGNER: Ananda Gupta &amp; Jason Matthews<br/>MAP,  CARD,  &amp; COUNTER ART: Mark Simonitch<br/><br/><br/>A deluxe edition,  published in 2009 includes the following changes from the basic game:<br/><br/>     Mounted map with revised graphics<br/>     Two double-thick counter sheets with 260 counters<br/>     Deck of 110 event cards (increased from 103)<br/>     Revised rules and player aid cards<br/>     Revised at start setup and text change for card #98 Aldrich Ames<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Upgrade kit for the owners of the previous version includes the following:<br/><br/>     Mounted Map with revised graphics<br/>     New card decks<br/>     Updated Rules &amp; Charts<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>",

    "Description": "Regarded by many as Reiner Knizia's masterpiece,  Tigris &amp; Euphrates is set in the ancient fertile crescent with players building civilizations through tile placement. Players are given four different leaders: farming,  trading,  religion,  and government. The leaders are used to collect victory points in these same categories. However,  your score at the end of the game is the number of points in your weakest category,  which encourages players not to get overly specialized. Conflict arises when civilizations connect on the board,  i.e.,  external conflicts,  with only one leader of each type surviving such a conflict. Leaders can also be replaced within a civilization through internal conflicts.<br/><br/>Starting in the Mayfair edition from 2008,  Tigris &amp; Euphrates included a double-sided game board and extra components for playing an advanced version of the game. This &quot;ziggurat expansion&quot;,  initially released as a separate item in Germany for those who already owned the base game,  is a special monument that extends across five spaces of the board. The monument can be built if a player has a cross of five civilization tokens of the same color by discarding those five tokens and replacing them with the ziggurat markers,  placing a ziggurat tower upon the middle tile. The five ziggurat markers cannot be destroyed. All rules regarding monuments apply to the ziggurat monument as well. If your king is inside the kingdom of the ziggurat,  you will get one victory point in a color of your choice at the end of your turn.<br/><br/>Some versions of Tigris &amp; Euphrates are listed as being for 2-4 players,  while others incorrectly state that they're for 3-4 players. Tigris &amp; Euphrates is part of what is sometimes called Reiner Knizia's tile-laying trilogy.<br/><br/>",

In Trajan,  a player has six possible actions: building,  trading,  taking tiles from the forum,  using the military,  influencing the Senate,  and placing Trajan tiles on his tableau.<br/><br/>At the start of the game,  each player has two differently colored pieces in each of the six sections (bowls) of his tableau. On a turn,  the player picks up all the pieces in one bowl and distributes them one-by-one in bowls in a clockwise order. Wherever the final piece is placed,  the player takes the action associated with that bowl; in addition,  if the colored pieces in that bowl match the colors shown on a Trajan tile next to the bowl (with tiles being placed at the start of the game and through later actions),  then the player takes the additional action shown on that tile.<br/><br/>What are you trying to do with these actions? Acquire victory points (VPs) in whatever ways are available to you &ndash; and since this is a Feld design,  you try to avoid being punished,  too. At the Forum you try to anticipate the demands of the public so that you can supply them what they want and not suffer a penalty. In the Senate you acquire influence which translates into votes on VP-related laws,  ideally snagging a law that fits your long-term plans. With the military,  you take control of regions in Europe,  earning more points for those regions far from Rome.<br/><br/>All game components are language neutral,  and the playing time is 30 minutes per player.<br/><br/>",

    "Description": "Lorenzo de' Medici,  also known as &quot;Lorenzo il Magnifico&quot; (Lorenzo the Magnificent),  was one of the most powerful and enthusiastic patrons of the Italian Renaissance.<br/><br/>In Lorenzo il Magnifico,  each player takes the role of the head of a noble family in a city during the Italian Renaissance to gain more prestige and fame &mdash; that is,  victory points (VP) &mdash; than anyone else. To do so,  you send your family members to different areas of town,  where they can obtain many achievements. In one location,  they get useful resources; in another development cards that represent newly conquered territories,  sponsored buildings,  influenced characters,  or encouraged ventures; and somewhere else they activate the effects of their cards.<br/><br/>Family members are not identical. At the beginning of each round,  you roll three dice to determine their value. You must choose carefully where to send your most valuable family members...<br/><br/>You can gain VP in several ways,  and you must also pay attention to your relations with the Church. The game is divided into three periods,  each formed by two rounds; at the end of each period,  players must show their faith,  and whoever hasn't prayed enough will suffer hard penalties. After six rounds,  you calculate your final score,  and the player with the most VP wins.<br/><br/>",

    "Description": "In Pandemic,  several virulent diseases have broken out simultaneously all over the world! The players are disease-fighting specialists whose mission is to treat disease hotspots while researching cures for each of four plagues before they get out of hand.<br/><br/>The game board depicts several major population centers on Earth. On each turn,  a player can use up to four actions to travel between cities,  treat infected populaces,  discover a cure,  or build a research station. A deck of cards provides the players with these abilities,  but sprinkled throughout this deck are Epidemic! cards that accelerate and intensify the diseases' activity. A second,  separate deck of cards controls the &quot;normal&quot; spread of the infections.<br/><br/>Taking a unique role within the team,  players must plan their strategy to mesh with their specialists' strengths in order to conquer the diseases. For example,  the Operations Expert can build research stations which are needed to find cures for the diseases and which allow for greater mobility between cities; the Scientist needs only four cards of a particular disease to cure it instead of the normal five&mdash;but the diseases are spreading quickly and time is running out. If one or more diseases spreads beyond recovery or if too much time elapses,  the players all lose. If they cure the four diseases,  they all win!<br/><br/>The 2013 edition of Pandemic includes two new characters&mdash;the Contingency Planner and the Quarantine Specialist&mdash;not available in earlier editions of the game.<br/><br/>Pandemic is the first game in the Pandemic series.<br/><br/>",

In the first round,  each team does the following: One team member takes a code card that shows three of the digits 1-4 in some order,  e.g.,  4-2-1. They then give a coded message that their teammates must use to guess this code. For example,  if the team's four words are &quot;pig&quot;,  &quot;candy&quot;,  &quot;tent&quot;,  and &quot;son&quot;,  then I might say &quot;Sam-striped-pink&quot; and hope that my teammates can correctly map those words to 4-2-1. If they guess correctly,  great; if not,  we receive a black mark of failure.<br/><br/>Starting in the second round,  a member of each team must again give a clue about their words to match a numbered code. If I get 2-4-3,  I might now say,  &quot;sucker-prince-stake&quot;. The other team then attempts to guess our numbered code. If they're correct,  they receive a white mark of success; if not,  then my team must guess the number correctly or take a black mark of failure. (Guessing correctly does nothing except avoid failure and give the opposing team information about what our hidden words might be.)<br/><br/>The rounds continue until a team collects either its second white mark (winning the game) or its second black mark (losing the game). Games typically last between 4-7 rounds. If neither team has won after eight rounds,  then each team must attempt to guess the other team's words; whichever team guesses more words correctly wins.<br/><br/>",

    "Description": "The shifting Warp Storms that surround the long lost Herakon Cluster have finally abated,  leaving the ancient treasures and planets within this sector open to the rest of the galaxy. Now,  the great factions of the galaxy mobilize their fleets and race to establish a foothold. The reward for successful domination surpasses all other concerns,  and the price for conquering this sector will be paid in lives.<br/><br/>Forbidden Stars challenges you and up to three other players to take command of a mighty fighting force: the Ultramarines chapter of Space Marines,  the Eldar of Craftworld Iyanden,  the Evil Sunz Ork clan,  or the World Eaters Warband of the Chaos Space Marines. Each faction offers unique armies and play styles,  but your goal remains the same &mdash; to claim the key objectives selected for your faction. These objective tokens are scattered throughout the Herakon Cluster,  but your opponents are sure to defend your objectives against you. You need to build massive armies and command them in unending war to best your enemies and claim your objectives. The fight for the Herakon Cluster is brutal and bloody,  and either you will stride triumphant over the bodies of your fallen foes &mdash; or they will do the same to you.<br/><br/>Each round in Forbidden Stars is divided into three phases. In the planning phase,  players take turns placing order tokens face down on the separate tiles (systems) that make up the game board; the four types of order tokens that players can place correspond to four types of actions that players can resolve in the second phase of play. In the operations phase,  players reveal their tokens to:<br/><br/><br/>     Dominate,  draining friendly planets of their important resources<br/>     Strategize,  purchasing cards that can upgrade their orders and combat abilities<br/>     Deploy,  building cities,  factories,  bastions,  and new mobile units<br/>     Advance,  moving units and attacking their enemies.<br/><br/><br/>The last phase of each round is the refresh phase,  during which players profit from the planets they control,  reveal event cards to move the impassable Warp Storms,  and heal any units wounded in battle.<br/><br/>Because of the game's three-phase structure,  strategy in Forbidden Stars is balanced between short-term bluffing and long-term tactical military action. The game's set-up also poses strategic opportunities. Players start the game by taking turns assembling sections of the Herakon Cluster,  placing individual system tiles along with their own starting forces and the enemy objectives that they must defend. This intentional construction,  along with the unique domination abilities of the game's four factions,  means that players must work to best utilize their own force's strengths while exploiting the weaknesses of their opponents.<br/><br/>",

Players can try to achieve one of three different victory conditions:<br/><br/><br/>     Leadership: Be the leader &mdash; i.e.,  have more clan figures than any other player &mdash; of territories containing at least six opponents' clans.<br/>     Land: Have your clans present in at least six different territories.<br/>     Religion: Have your clans present in territories that collectively contain at least six sanctuaries.<br/><br/><br/>Over the course of the game,  players also earn deeds,  typically chanted by bards or engraved by master crafters,  that reduce by one the magic total of six for any condition. While one victory condition is enough to claim the title of King,  a game of experienced players usually has a tight balance of power,  emphasizing the leadership of the capital of the island.<br/><br/>At the start of each round,  players draft a hand of four action cards (with 13 action cards for three players and 17 for four players) during the Assembly. Action cards not played at the end of one season are not held for the next. Players also have access to leader cards for the territories that allow it and where they were elected leader during the assembly. Each Assembly reallocates those cards. Finally,  they collect &quot;epic tales&quot; cards that depict the deeds of the ancient Irish gods and heroes,  like Cuchulainn,  the Dagda,  Lugh and many others. These will be kept and used to inspire the clans and achieve extraordinary feats...under the right circumstances. The cards provide a variety of actions: adding clans,  moving clans,  building/exploring,  and special actions.<br/><br/>Careful drafting,  hand management,  bluffing (especially once players understand the importance of passing their turn),  good timing,  and a precise understanding of the balance of power are the keys to victory. After a discovery game you'll be ready for a full and epic game,  where an undisputed player will be king by the Assembly for his merit and wisdom.<br/><br/>While Inis has &quot;dudes&quot; that are &quot;on a map&quot;,  it's a beginner's mistake to play this as a battle game because eliminating other clans reduces your chances of scoring a Leadership victory condition. Peace among different clans,  with or without a clear territory leader,  is the usual outcome of a clan's movement. Battles will occur,  of course,  as the Celtic clans can be unruly and a good player will listen to his clan's people (i.e.,  his hand of cards). That battle aspect is reflected in the clan's miniatures representing warriors. Woodsmen,  shepherds and traders complete the set of twelve minis for each player; these occupations have no impact on the game,  but give it flavor.<br/><br/>",

    "Description": "Star Wars: X-Wing Miniatures Game is a tactical ship-to-ship combat game in which players take control of powerful Rebel X-wings and nimble Imperial TIE fighters,  facing them against each other in fast-paced space combat. Featuring stunningly detailed and painted miniatures,  the X-Wing Miniatures Game recreates exciting Star Wars space combat throughout its several included scenarios. Select your crew,  plan your maneuvers,  and complete your mission!<br/><br/>Whatever your chosen vessel,  the rules of X-Wing facilitate fast and visceral gameplay that puts you in the middle of Star Wars fiercest firefights. Each ship type has its own unique piloting dial,  which is used to secretly select a speed and maneuver each turn. After planning maneuvers,  each ship's dial is revealed and executed (starting with the lowest skilled pilot). So whether you rush headlong toward your enemy showering his forward deflectors in laser fire,  or dance away from him as you attempt to acquire a targeting lock,  you'll be in total control throughout all the tense dogfighting action.<br/><br/>Star Wars: X-Wing features (three) unique missions,  and each has its own set of victory conditions and special rules; with such a broad selection of missions,  only clever and versatile pilots employing a range of tactics will emerge victorious. What's more,  no mission will ever play the same way twice,  thanks to a range of customization options,  varied maneuvers,  and possible combat outcomes. Damage,  for example,  is determined through dice and applied in the form of a shuffled Damage Deck. For some hits your fighter sustains,  you'll draw a card that assigns a special handicap. Was your targeting computer damaged,  affecting your ability to acquire a lock on the enemy? Perhaps an ill-timed weapon malfunction will limit your offensive capabilities. Or worse yet,  your pilot could be injured,  compromising his ability to focus on the life-and-death struggle in which he is engaged...<br/><br/>The Star Wars: X-Wing starter set includes everything you need to begin your battles,  such as scenarios,  cards,  and fully assembled and painted ships. What's more,  Star Wars: X-Wing's quick-to-learn ruleset establishes the foundation for a system that can be expanded with your favorite ships and characters from the Star Wars universe.<br/><br/>Reimplemented by Star Wars: X-Wing (Second Edition)<br/><br/>",

    "Description": "In Alchemists,  two to four budding alchemists compete to discover the secrets of their mystical art. Points can be earned in various ways,  but most points are earned by publishing theories &ndash; correct theories,  that is &mdash; and therein lies the problem.<br/><br/>The game is played in six rounds. At the beginning of the round,  players choose their play order. Those who choose to play later get more rewards.<br/>Players declare all their actions by placing cubes on the various action spaces,  then each action space is evaluated in order. Players gain knowledge by mixing ingredients and testing the results using a smartphone app (iOS,  Android,  and also Windows) that randomizes the rules of alchemy for each new game. And if the alchemists are longing for something even more special,  they can always buy magical artifacts to get an extra push. There are 9 of them (different for each game) and they are not only very powerful,  but also very expensive. But money means nothing,  when there's academic pride at stake! And the possession of these artifacts will definitely earn you some reputation too. Players can also earn money by selling potions of questionable quality to adventurers,  but money is just a means to an end. The alchemists don't want riches,  after all. They want respect,  and respect usually comes from publishing theories.<br/><br/>During play,  players' reputations will go up and down. After six rounds and a final exhibition,  reputation will be converted into points. Points will also be scored for artifacts and grants. Then the secrets of alchemy are revealed and players score points or lose points based on whether their theories were correct. Whoever has the most points at the end of the game wins.<br/><br/>Flavor text:<br/>Mandrake root and scorpion tail; spongy mushroom and warty toad &mdash; these are the foundations of the alchemist's livelihood,  science,  and art.<br/><br/>But what arcane secrets do these strange ingredients hide? Now it is time to find out. Mix them into potions and drink them to determine their effects &mdash; or play it safe and test the concoction on a helpful assistant! Gain riches selling potions to wandering adventurers and invest these riches in powerful artifacts. As your knowledge grows,  so will your reputation,  as you publish your theories for all to see. Knowledge,  wealth,  and fame can all be found in the murky depths of the alchemist's cauldron.<br/><br/>",

    "Description": "The &quot;Stone Age&quot; times were hard indeed. In their roles as hunters,  collectors,  farmers,  and tool makers,  our ancestors worked with their legs and backs straining against wooden plows in the stony earth. Of course,  progress did not stop with the wooden plow. People always searched for better tools and more productive plants to make their work more effective.<br/><br/>In Stone Age,  the players live in this time,  just as our ancestors did. They collect wood,  break stone and wash their gold from the river. They trade freely,  expand their village and so achieve new levels of civilization. With a balance of luck and planning,  the players compete for food in this pre-historic time.<br/><br/>Players use up to ten tribe members each in three phases. In the first phase,  players place their men in regions of the board that they think will benefit them,  including the hunt,  the trading center,  or the quarry. In the second phase,  the starting player activates each of his staffed areas in whatever sequence he chooses,  followed in turn by the other players. In the third phase,  players must have enough food available to feed their populations,  or they face losing resources or points.<br/><br/>",

    "Description": "Star Realms is a spaceship combat deck-building game by Magic Hall of Famers Darwin Kastle (The Battle for Hill 218) and Rob Dougherty (Ascension Co-designer).<br/><br/>Star Realms is a fast paced deck-building card game of outer space combat. It combines the fun of a deck-building game with the interactivity of Trading Card Game style combat. As you play,  you make use of Trade to acquire new Ships and Bases from the cards being turned face up in the Trade Row from the Trade Deck. You use the Ships and Bases you acquire to either generate more Trade or to generate Combat to attack your opponent and their bases. When you reduce your opponent&rsquo;s score (called Authority) to zero,  you win!<br/><br/>Multiple decks of Star Realms and/or Star Realms: Colony Wars,  one for every two people,  allows up to six players to play a variety of scenarios. Also,  in the newest version,  there are new ways to play that allow up to 6 players with modes like Boss,  Hunter,  and Free for All. You can also add Star Realms Colony Wars to the deck to make it 4 players. This is the first game of the Star Realms series.<br/><br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tFactions<br/><br/>Each of the cards in the 80 card Trade Deck is a Ship or a Base belonging to one of four factions: The Trade Federation,  The Blobs,  The Star Empire or The Machine Cult.<br/><br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tTrade Federation<br/><br/>In the far future,  the more traditional governing bodies of the human race have been replaced with corporate leadership. The earth and its surrounding colonies are ruled by a group of corporations called the Trade Federation. The Federation&rsquo;s policies are focused around trade and growth,  but especially in profit and prosperity for those at the top of the corporate ladder. While they prefer to deal with other star realms using trade and diplomacy,  they have a large defense branch dedicated to protecting the Federation&rsquo;s trade and other interests.<br/><br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tThe Blobs<br/><br/>These mysterious creatures are the first alien life forms encountered by the human race. Most of the initial encounters consisted of human colonies being completely obliterated. On the few occasions that a Blob ship has been recovered somewhat intact,  the only biological remains found inside have consisted of a gelatinous mass,  thus leading to the moniker,  &ldquo;The Blobs&rdquo;. While for several years all encounters between humanity and the Blobs have been extremely violent,  there is currently some limited trade between various Blob factions and some of the more daring human traders.The Blobs are best at generating massive amounts of Combat and at removing undesirable cards from the Trade Row.<br/><br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tStar Empire<br/><br/>The Star Empire consists primarily of former colonies of the Trade Federation. These colonies were on the outer edges of the Federation. Not only did they feel used by the corporations,  but they felt the Federation failed to give them adequate protection from the Blobs. As a result,  one ambitious colonial governor was able to unite several colonies into an independent empire under his control,  one with a strong military,  both for warding off the Blobs and for discouraging the Federation from trying to reclaim their lost colonies. The Star Empire is a combat oriented faction that draws lots of cards and makes the opponent discard cards.<br/><br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tMachine Cult<br/><br/>A cluster of industrial mining worlds were completely cut off from the Trade Federation by the Blobs. With the threat of annihilation by the Blobs always looming and no contact with the rest of human space,  these worlds were forced to take drastic measures. Soon a cult of technology arose,  focused on using advanced technology,  robotics and computerization to create strong defenses and a powerful military that belied their relatively small population. Since their leaders believed their salvation lay in technology,  technology soon became their god and their religion. The Machine Cult gains most of its power from being able to remove undesirable cards from your deck and from having a large number of Bases designed to defend your Authority from attack.<br/><br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tPlaying Star Realms<br/><br/>\u200bWhen you play Star Realms,  you will be able to acquire and use Ships and Bases of any and all of the four factions. Many cards have powerful Ally abilities that reward you for using Ships and Bases of the same faction together,  however.<br/><br/>As you acquire cards using Trade,  you put them into your discard pile,  to be later shuffled into your personal deck. When you draw Ships,  you do what they say and they get placed into your discard pile at the end of your turn. When you draw a Base,  you play it face up in front of you and may use its abilities once every turn. In addition to Combat being the way you reduce your opponent&rsquo;s Authority to zero and win the game,  it&rsquo;s also useful for destroying your opponent&rsquo;s Bases. Some Bases are designated as Outposts. Your opponent&rsquo;s Outposts must be destroyed before you can use Combat to attack your opponent&rsquo;s Authority directly.<br/><br/>Star Realms is easy to learn,  especially if you&rsquo;re familiar with deck-building games,  but it&rsquo;s a game that takes time to master. Each time you play,  the game is filled with various strategic decision points. Should I take the best card for me or the best card for my opponent? Should I focus on taking cards of a particular faction or on taking the best card available? Should I be focusing on acquiring more Trade or more Combat? Should I attack my opponent&rsquo;s Base or their Authority? These are just some of the many choices you&rsquo;ll be faced with. New players needn&rsquo;t agonize over these choices just to play,  but as they become more advanced players,  they will find this depth of strategy leads to great replayability.<br/><br/>",

For such times,  Descent: Journeys in the Dark (Second Edition) uses a unique dice-based system.

    "Description": "There's hustle and bustle at Istanbul's grand bazaar as merchants and their assistants rush through the narrow alleys in their attempt to be more successful than their competitors. Everything must be well organized: wheelbarrows must be filled with goods at the warehouses,  then swiftly transported by the assistants to various destinations. Your goal? Be the first merchant to collect a certain number of rubies.<br/><br/>In Istanbul,  you lead a group of one merchant and four assistants through 16 locations in the bazaar. At each such location,  you can carry out a specific action. The challenge,  though,  is that to take an action,  you must move your merchant and an assistant there,  then leave the assistant behind (to handle all the details while you focus on larger matters). If you want to use that assistant again later,  your merchant must return to that location to pick him up. Thus,  you must plan ahead carefully to avoid being left with no assistants and thus unable to do anything...<br/><br/>In more detail,  on a turn you move your merchant and his retinue of assistants one or two steps through the bazaar,  either leave an assistant at that location or collect an assistant left earlier,  then perform the action. If you meet other merchants or certain individuals at the location,  you might be able to take a small extra action. Possible actions include:<br/><br/><br/>    Paying to increase your wheelbarrow capacity,  which starts the game with a capacity of only two for each good.<br/>    Filling your wheelbarrow with a specified good to its limit.<br/>    Acquiring a special ability,  and the earlier you come,  the easier they are to collect.<br/>    Buying rubies or trading goods for rubies.<br/>    Selling special combinations of goods to make the money you need to do everything else.<br/><br/><br/>When a merchant has collected five rubies in his wheelbarrow,  players complete that round,  then the game ends. If this player is the only one who's reached this goal,  he wins immediately; otherwise ties are broken by money in hand.<br/><br/>",

From Edinburgh to Constantinople and from Lisbon to Moscow,  you'll visit great cities of turn-of-the-century Europe. Like the original Ticket to Ride,  the game remains elegantly simple,  can be learned in 5 minutes,  and appeals to both families and experienced gamers. Ticket to Ride: Europe is a complete,  new game and does not require the original version.<br/><br/>More than just a new map,  Ticket to Ride: Europe features brand new gameplay elements. Tunnels may require you to pay extra cards to build on them,  Ferries require locomotive cards in order to claim them,  and Stations allow you to sacrifice a few points in order to use an opponent's route to connect yours. The game also includes larger format cards and Train Station game pieces.<br/><br/>The overall goal remains the same: collect and play train cards in order to place your pieces on the board,  attempting to connect cities on your ticket cards. Points are earned both from placing trains and completing tickets but uncompleted tickets lose you points. The player who has the most points at the end of the game wins.<br/><br/>Copyright 2002-2014 Days of Wonder,  inc.<br/><br/>Part of the Ticket to Ride series.<br/><br/>",

    "Description": "&quot;Crossroads&quot; is a game series from Plaid Hat Games that tests a group of survivors' ability to work together and stay alive while facing crises and challenges from both outside and inside. Dead of Winter: A Crossroads Game,  the first title in this series,  puts 2-5 players in a small,  weakened colony of survivors in a world in which most of humanity is either dead or diseased,  flesh-craving monsters. Each player leads a faction of survivors,  with dozens of different characters in the game.<br/><br/>Dead of Winter is a meta-cooperative psychological survival game. This means players are working together toward one common victory condition,  but for each individual player to achieve victory,  they must also complete their personal secret objective,  which could relate to a psychological tick that's fairly harmless to most others in the colony,  a dangerous obsession that could put the main objective at risk,  a desire for sabotage of the main mission,  or (worst of all) vengeance against the colony! Games could end with all players winning,  some winning and some losing,  or all players losing. Work toward the group's goal,  but don't get walked all over by a loudmouth who's looking out only for their own interests!<br/><br/>Dead of Winter is an experience that can be accomplished only through the medium of tabletop games,  a story-centric game about surviving through a harsh winter in an apocalyptic world. The survivors are all dealing with their own psychological imperatives,  but must still find a way to work together to fight off outside threats,  resolve crises,  find food and supplies,  and keep the colony's morale up.<br/><br/>Dead of Winter has players making frequent,  difficult,  heavily-thematic,  wildly-varying decisions that often have them deciding between what's best for the colony and what's best for themselves. The rulebook also includes a fully co-operative variant in which all players work toward the group objective with no personal goals.<br/><br/>",

    "Description": "Theme and overview:<br/><br/>Unlike in other cultures,  the desert Tuareg men,  known as Targi,  cover their faces whereas women of the tribe do not wear veils. They run the household and they have the last word at home in the tents. Different families are divided into tribes,  headed by the &lsquo;Imascheren&rsquo; (or nobles). As leader of a Tuareg tribe,  players trade goods from near (such as dates and salt) and far (like pepper),  in order to obtain gold and other benefits,  and enlarge their family. In each round their new offerings are made. Cards are a means to an end,  in order to obtain the popular tribe cards.<br/><br/>Gameplay:<br/><br/>The board consists of a 5x5 grid: a border of 16 squares with printed action symbols and then 9 blank squares in the centre onto which cards are dealt. Meeples are placed one at a time on the spaces at the edges of the board (not including corner squares). You cannot place a meeple on a square the opponent has a meeple on already,  nor on a square facing opponent's meeple. Once all meeples are placed,  players then execute the actions on the border squares the meeples are on and also take the cards from the centre that match the row and column of the border meeples.<br/><br/>The game is predominantly scored and won by playing tribal cards to your display. These give advantages during the game and victory points at the end. Usually cards are played (or discarded) immediately once drawn. A single card can be kept in hand but then requires a special action to play it (or to discard it to free the hand spot for another card). Each card has a cost in goods to play. Goods are obtained either from border spaces or from goods cards.<br/><br/>The display (for scoring) consists of 3 rows of 4 cards that are filled from left to right and cannot be moved once placed (barring some special cards). There is also a balance to be found between the victory point score on the cards themselves (1-3 VP per tribal card) and in the combinations per row (a full row of 4 identical card types gets you an additional 4 VP,  and a full row of 4 distinct card types gets you 2 VP).<br/><br/>The winner at the end of the game is the player with the most victory points.<br/><br/>",

    "Description": "In War of the Ring,  one player takes control of the Free Peoples (FP),  the other player controls Shadow Armies (SA).<br/><br/>Initially,  the Free People Nations are reluctant to take arms against Sauron,  so they must be attacked by Sauron or persuaded by Gandalf or other Companions,  before they start to fight properly: this is represented by the Political Track,  which shows if a Nation is ready to fight in the War of the Ring or not.<br/><br/>The game can be won by a military victory,  if Sauron conquers a certain number of Free People cities and strongholds or vice-versa. But the true hope of the Free Peoples lies with the quest of the Ringbearer: while the armies clash across Middle Earth,  the Fellowship of the Ring is trying to get secretly to Mount Doom to destroy the One Ring. Sauron is not aware of the real intention of his enemies but is looking across Middle Earth for the precious Ring,  so that the Fellowship is going to face numerous dangers,  represented by the rules of The Hunt for the Ring. But the Companions can spur the Free Peoples to the fight against Sauron,  so the Free People player must balance the need to protect the Ringbearer from harm,  against the attempt to raise a proper defense against the armies of the Shadow,  so that they do not overrun Middle Earth before the Ringbearer completes his quest.<br/><br/>Each game turn revolves around the roll of Action Dice: each die corresponds to an action that a player can do during a turn. Depending on the face rolled on each die,  different actions are possible (moving armies,  characters,  recruiting troops,  advancing a Political Track).<br/><br/>Action dice can also be used to draw or play Event Cards. Event Cards are played to represent specific events from the story (or events that could possibly have happened) that cannot be portrayed through normal gameplay. Each Event Card can also create an unexpected turn in the game,  allowing special actions or altering the course of a battle.<br/><br/>Reimplemented by:<br/><br/>    War of the Ring Collector's Edition<br/>    War of the Ring: Second Edition<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Upgrade to the 2nd edition (Card Pack) <br/><br/>    War of the Ring (second edition): Upgrade Kit<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>",

Instead you flip cards from three piles to make three different action sets with both a house number and a corresponding action from which everyone chooses one. You use the number to fill in a house on your street in numerical order. Then you take the action to increase the point value of estates you build or score points at the end for building parks and pools. Players also have the option of taking actions to alter or duplicate their house numbers. And everyone is racing to be the first to complete public goals. There's lots to do and many paths to becoming the best suburban architect in Welcome To...!<br/><br/>Because of the communal actions,  game play is simultaneous and thus supports large groups of players.

They are striving for fortune and fame in a competition hosted by a legendary magician,  looking for a successor worthy of the mighty Trickerion Stone,  which is fabled to grant supernatural power to its owner.<br/><br/>Using worker placement and simultaneous action selection mechanisms,  the Illusionists and their teams of helpers &mdash; the Engineer,  the Assistant,  the Manager,  and a handful of Apprentices &ndash; obtain blueprints and components for increasingly complex magic tricks,  expand the team and set up performances by visiting the Downtown,  Dark Alley,  Market Row and Theater locations on the main game board depicting a late 19th century cityscape.<br/><br/>The tricks are stored and prepared on the Magician's own Workshop game board,  while the performances themselves take place at the Theater in the form of a tile placement mini-game with lots of player interaction. The performances yield Fame points and Coins to their owners based on the tricks they consist of. Fame points have multiple uses,  but they also serve as a win condition - After turn 7,  when the last Performance card is revealed,  the game ends and the illusionist with the most Fame points wins.<br/><br/>The game offers 48 different Tricks to be learned from the Optical,  Spiritual,  Mechanical and Escape categories,  over 90 character abilities,  and 40 Special Assignment cards that influence the actions taken at the various game locations. The base game can be expanded with two optional rule modules to add further strategic depth to the game.<br/><br/>The &quot;Dark Alley&quot; expansion included in the base game adds a new location to the game. It also comes with 48 new Special Assignment cards,  a new tier of Tricks,  and 27 Prophecy tokens that can alter certain game rules turn by turn,  giving the game additional variety.<br/><br/>",

    "Description": "Railways of the World (2009) is the new edition of the base game for Eagle Games' popular Railways of the World series,  first published as Railroad Tycoon in 2005.  It reimplements the original game with several improvements.<br/><br/>Revisit the early days of the Age of Steam as you begin with a locomotive (the venerable John Bull,  the first locomotive to run in North America) and a vision (your Tycoon &quot;mission&quot; card). From there,  build your budding railroad network into a vast empire. Connect New York to Chicago,  earn the most money,  develop bigger and faster locomotives and maybe even span North America and build the Transcontinental Railway!<br/><br/>Multiple expansions featuring different maps are available.  Railways of the World is the new base game for the system and includes the engine placards,  railroad tiles,  train tokens,  money,  bonds,  and other items that are needed in almost all the Railways of the World series. A gameboard depicting the eastern half of the United States is included in the base game,  as well as a mounted map of Mexico.<br/><br/>This game is preceded by the designer's other Winsome train games: Age of Steam,  Australian Railways,  Volldampf,  New England Railways,  Veld Spoorweg,  Lancashire Railways,  and Ferrocarriles Pampas.  Railroad Tycoon was the result of a collaboration with Glenn Drover,  in which the mechanics and game-play of Martin Wallace's Age of Steam were simplified and streamlined and attractive over-produced components were added,  in order to make Railroad Tycoon more appealing to less hardcore gamers and more accessible to a wider audience.<br/><br/>A revised reprint was published at the end of 2010 which made some component improvements,  such as the addition of Railroad Operation cards for the Mexico map.<br/><br/>Complete series overview - The Railways of the World Series: Introducing the family members of the ideal medium-weight train game<br/><br/>Note: The RailRoad Tycoon board itself is gigantic (about 36x45 inches,  91x114 cm) and requires a huge table or playing on the floor.<br/><br/>Similar to:<br/><br/>     Steam<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>",

    "Description": "The Lord of the Rings: The Card Game is a cooperative adventure game in which the players attempt to complete a scenario,  each with three heroes of their choice and a deck of allies,  events and attachments to support them. Each round,  players send their heroes and allies to quest or to fight with enemies that engage them. However,  as the heroes and allies exhaust after questing,  defending,  or attacking,  the players' options are typically insufficient to deal with everything at once. Therefore,  players need to determine whether it is more urgent to quest and make progress in the scenario while the enemy forces gain power,  or to take down enemies while making no progress,  not knowing what will come next.<br/><br/>The Lord of the Rings: The Card Game is the base game of a Living Card Game for which new adventure packs are released monthly. The base game contains three scenarios,  twelve famous characters from the works of J.R.R. Tolkien (including Aragorn,  Legolas,  Gimli,  Denethor and Eowyn),  and four pre-constructed player decks. Players can either use one of these decks or construct their own deck to increase their chances to be successful in the more challenging scenarios. The monthly adventure packs contain a new scenario,  a new hero,  and new player cards to be used in their deck. The base game is for 1-2 players,  but with an additional base game the scenarios can be played with up to four players.<br/><br/>Although this game is set in Tolkien's Middle Earth,  the scenarios do not represent scenes from the books,  but rather take place in the seventeen years from Bilbo's 111th birthday until Frodo's departure from the Shire.<br/><br/>The scenarios from saga-expansions do represent scenes from the books. Saga-expansions will form the Campaign Mode so that you can play all the saga quests that deal with the trilogy (+ Hobbit) together in one marathon campaign.<br/><br/>",

    "Description": "Game description from the publisher:<br/><br/>King Robert Baratheon is dead,  and the lands of Westeros brace for battle.<br/><br/>In the second edition of A Game of Thrones: The Board Game,  three to six players take on the roles of the great Houses of the Seven Kingdoms of Westeros,  as they vie for control of the Iron Throne through the use of diplomacy and warfare. Based on the best-selling A Song of Ice and Fire series of fantasy novels by George R.R. Martin,  A Game of Thrones is an epic board game in which it will take more than military might to win. Will you take power through force,  use honeyed words to coerce your way onto the throne,  or rally the townsfolk to your side? Through strategic planning,  masterful diplomacy,  and clever card play,  spread your influence over Westeros!<br/><br/>To begin the game,  each player receives an army of Footman,  Knight,  Siege Engine,  and Ship units,  as well as a set of Order tokens and other necessary components. Each player also receives a deck of unique House Cards,  which are used as leaders in battles against rival Houses.<br/><br/>Each round in the game is made up of three phases: the Westeros Phase,  the Planning Phase,  and the Action Phase. The Westeros Phase represents special events and day-to-day activities in Westeros. There are three different Westeros Decks,  and each denotes a different global action,  potentially affecting all players.<br/><br/>The Planning Phase is perhaps the most important. Here you secretly assign orders to all of your units by placing one order token face down on each area you control that contains at least one unit (Knight,  Footman,  Ship,  or Siege Engine). This portion of the game emphasizes diplomacy and deduction. Can you trust the alliance that you made? Will you betray your ally and march upon him? Players may make promises to each other (for aid or peace,  for example),  but these promises are never binding. The result is tense and compelling negotiations,  often ending in backstabbing worthy of Westeros!<br/><br/>During the Action Phase,  the orders are resolved and battle is entered! When armies meet in combat,  they secretly choose one of their House cards to add strength to the battle. Finally,  the Houses can consolidate their power in the areas they control and use that power in future turns to influence their position in the court of the Iron Throne and to stand against the wildling Hordes.<br/><br/>In addition to featuring updated graphics and a clarified ruleset,  this second edition of A Game of Thrones includes elements from the A Clash of Kings and A Storm of Swords expansions,  including ports,  garrisons,  Wildling cards,  and Siege engines,  while introducing welcome new innovations like player screens and Tides of Battle cards.<br/><br/>Tides of Battle cards are an optional mechanism that brings an element of unpredictability to combat,  representing erratic shifts in the momentum of war due to factors such as weather,  morale,  and tactical opportunity. During each combat,  both players draw one Tides of Battle card from a communal deck,  and its value modifies the strength of his chosen House card. What's more,  such a card may also contain icons that can affect the outcome of the battle...all of which delivers a new level of intensity to your military engagements.<br/><br/>Expanded by:<br/><br/>     A Game of Thrones: The Board Game (Second Edition) \u2013 A Dance with Dragons (2012)<br/>     A Game of Thrones: The Board Game (Second Edition) \u2013 A Feast for Crows (2013)<br/>     A Game of Thrones: The Board Game (Second Edition) \u2013 Mother of Dragons (2018)<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Reimplements:<br/><br/>     A Game of Thrones (2003)<br/>     A Game of Thrones: A Clash of Kings Expansion (2004)<br/>     A Game of Thrones: A Storm of Swords Expansion (2006)<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>",

    "Description": "In the tile-laying game Castles of Mad King Ludwig,  players are tasked with building an amazing,  extravagant castle for King Ludwig II of Bavaria...one room at a time. You see,  the King loves castles,  having built Neuschwanstein (the castle that inspired the Disney theme park castles) and others,  but now he's commissioned you to build the biggest,  best castle ever &mdash; subject,  of course,  to his ever-changing whims. Each player acts as a building contractor who is adding rooms to the castle he's building while also selling his services to other players.<br/><br/>In the game,  each player starts with a simple foyer. One player takes on the role of the Master Builder,  and that player sets prices for a set of rooms that can be purchased by the other players,  with him getting to pick from the leftovers after the other players have paid him for their rooms. When a room is added to a castle,  the player who built it gains castle points based on the size and type of room constructed,  as well as bonus points based on the location of the room. When a room is completed,  with all entranceways leading to other rooms in the castle,  the player receives one of seven special rewards.<br/><br/>After each purchasing round,  a new player becomes the Master Builder who sets prices for a new set of rooms. After several rounds,  the game ends,  then additional points are awarded for achieving bonus goals,  having the most popular rooms,  and being the most responsive to the King's demands,  which change each game. Whoever ends up with the most castle points wins.<br/><br/>",

Dino cooking! All players will compete to build the most thrilling park each season,  and then work to attract (and keep alive!) the most visitors each season that the park opens.<br/><br/>Do you go big and create a pack of Velociraptors? They'll definitely excite potential visitors,  but you'd better make a large enough enclosure for them. And maybe hire some (read: a lot of) security. Or they WILL break out and start eating your visitors,  and we all know how that ends. You could play it safe and grow a bunch of herbivores,  but then you aren't going to have the most exciting park in the world (sad face). So maybe buy a roller coaster or two to attract visitors to your park the good old-fashioned way?<br/><br/>",

    "Description": "You are one of the two most powerful traders in the city of Jaipur,  the capital of Rajasthan,  but that's not enough for you because only the merchant with two &quot;seals of excellence&quot; will have the privilege of being invited to the Maharaja's court. You are therefore going to have to do better than your direct competitor by buying,  exchanging,  and selling at better prices,  all while keeping an eye on both your camel herds.<br/><br/>Jaipur is a fast-paced card game,  a blend of tactics,  risk and luck. On your turn,  you can either take or sell cards. If you take cards,  you have to choose between taking all the camels,  taking one card from the market,  or swapping 2-5 cards between the market and your cards.<br/><br/>If you sell cards,  you get to sell only one type of good,  and you receive as many chips for that good as the number of cards you sold. The chips' values decrease as the game progresses,  so you'd better hurry! On the other hand,  you receive increasingly high rewards for selling three,  four,  or five cards of the same good at a time,  so you'd better wait!<br/><br/>You can't sell camels,  but they're paramount for trading and they're also worth a little something at the end of the round,  enough sometimes to secure the win,  so you have to use them smartly.<br/><br/>",

    "Description": "In Ora et Labora,  each player is head of a monastery in the Medieval era who acquires land and constructs buildings &ndash; little enterprises that will gain resources and profit. The goal is to build a working infrastructure and manufacture prestigious items &ndash; such as books,  ceramics,  ornaments,  and relics &ndash; to gain the most victory points at the end of the game.<br/><br/>Ora et Labora,  Uwe Rosenberg's fifth &quot;big&quot; game,  has game play mechanisms similar to his Le Havre,  such as two-sided resource tiles that can be upgraded from a basic item to something more useful. Instead of adding resources to the board turn by turn as in Agricola and Le Havre,  Ora et Labora uses a numbered rondel to show how many of each resource is available at any time. At the beginning of each round,  players turn the rondel by one segment,  adjusting the counts of all resources at the same time.<br/><br/>Each player has a personal game board. New buildings enter the game from time to time,  and players can construct them on their game boards with the building materials they gather,  with some terrain restrictions on what can be built where. Some spaces start with trees or moors on them,  as in Agricola: Farmers of the Moor,  so they hinder development until a player clears the land,  but they provide resources when they are removed. Clever building on your personal game board will impact your final score,  and players can buy additional terrain during the game,  if needed.<br/><br/>Players also have three workers who can enter buildings to take the action associated with that location. Workers must stay in place until you've placed all three. You can enter your own buildings with these workers,  but to enter and use another player's buildings,  you must pay that player an entry fee so that he'll move one of his workers into that building to do the work for you.<br/><br/>Ora et Labora features two variants: France and Ireland.<br/><br/>",

    "Description": "Memoir '44  is a historical boardgame where players face-off in stylized battles of some of the most famous historic battles of World War II including Omaha Beach,  Pegasus Bridge,  Operation Cobra and the Ardennes.<br/><br/>Memoir '44 includes over 15 different battle scenarios and features a double-sided hex game board for both beach landings and countryside combat. Each scenario mimics the historical terrain,  troop placements and objectives of each army. Commanders deploy troops through Command and Tactic cards,  applying the unique skills of his units -- infantry,  paratrooper,  tank,  artillery,  and even resistance fighters -- to their greatest strength.<br/><br/>&quot;By design,  the game is not overly complex&quot;,  says Memoir '44 designer,  Richard Borg. &quot;The game mechanics,  although simple,  still require strategic card play,  timely dice rolling and an aggressive yet flexible battle plan to achieve victory.&quot; In addition to the large,  double-sided gameboard,  Memoir '44 includes 144 amazingly detailed army miniatures - including historically accurate infantry,  tanks and artillery; 36 Obstacle pieces,  60 illustrated Command cards,  44 Special Terrain tiles,  and 8 Custom Wooden dice.<br/><br/>Memoir '44 is designed for 2 players but easily accommodates team play. And with Memoir '44 Overlord scenarios,  players can use multiple boards and up to 8 players to conduct large scale operations,  experiencing the challenges of troop coordination and military chain of command on a large scale battlefield. Average game length is between 30 and 60 minutes,  encouraging match play where players can command first one side and then the other.<br/><br/>The Memoir '44 series consists of the base game and a number of expansions.<br/><br/>This game is based upon Richard Borg's Command and Colors system.<br/><br/>",

While on the trail,  these hikers will take actions and collect memories of the places your hikers visit. These memories are represented by various resource tokens like mountains and forests. Collecting these memories in sets will allow players to trade them in to visit a National Park at the end of each hike.<br/><br/>Each trail represents one season of the year,  and each season,  the trails will change and grow steadily longer. The trails,  represented by tiles,  get shuffled in between each season and laid out anew for the next round. Resources can be tough to come by especially when someone is at the place you&rsquo;re trying to reach! Campfires allow you to share a space and time with other hikers. Canteens and Gear can also be used to improve your access to resources through the game.

Quite an ambitious undertaking for one game,  yet Commands &amp; Colors by design is a unique historical game system which allows players to effectively portray stylized battles from this time in history. The 15 battles,  showcased in the scenario booklet,  although stylized,  focus on important terrain features and the historical deployment of forces in scale with the game system. The battles include Bagradas,  Cannae,  and Zama.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;The scale of the game fluctuates from battle to battle. For some scenarios,  an infantry unit may represent a legion of fighters,  while in other scenarios a unit may represent just a few brave warriors. But the tactics you need to execute conform remarkably well to the advantages and limitations inherent to the various units,  their weapons,  terrain and time.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Unlike its older brother,  Battle Cry by Avalon Hill Games,  Inc.,  Commands &amp; Colors: Ancients is moderately more complex and contains additional historical details without the battlefield clutter. Most scenarios will still play to a conclusion in less than an hour.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;The command card system,  drives movement,  creates a true fog of war and presents both challenges and opportunities. There are four types of command cards: Leadership cards,  Section cards,  Troop cards and Tactic cards.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;The battle dice system resolves all combat efficiently and quickly. Each battle die has one Light,  one Medium,  one Heavy,  one Leader,  one Flag and one Swords symbol.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;The game mechanics,  although simple,  will still require strategic card play,  historical tactics,  timely dice rolling,  and an aggressive yet flexible battle plan,  to achieve victory.&quot;<br/><br/>",

    "Description": "Description from the publisher:<br/><br/>The T.I.M.E Agency protects humanity by preventing temporal faults and paradoxes from threatening the fabric of our universe. As temporal agents,  you and your team will be sent into the bodies of beings from different worlds or realities to successfully complete the missions given to you. Failure is impossible,  as you will be able to go back in time as many times as required.<br/><br/>T.I.M.E Stories is a narrative game,  a game of &quot;decksploration&quot;. Each player is free to give their character as deep a &quot;role&quot; as they want,  in order to live through a story,  as much in the game as around the table. But it's also a board game with rules which allow for reflection and optimization.<br/><br/>At the beginning of the game,  the players are at their home base and receive their mission briefing. The object is then to complete it in as few attempts as possible. The actions and movements of the players will use Temporal Units (TU),  the quantity of which depend on the scenario and the number of players. Each attempt is called a &quot;run&quot;; one run equals the use of all of the Temporal Units at the players' disposal. When the TU reach zero,  the agents are recalled to the agency,  and restart the scenario from the beginning,  armed with their experience. The object of the game is to make the perfect run,  while solving all of the puzzles and overcoming all of a scenario&rsquo;s obstacles.<br/><br/>The base box contains the entirety of the T.I.M.E Stories system and allows players to play all of the scenarios,  the first of which &mdash; Asylum &mdash; is included. During a scenario,  which consists of a deck of 120+ cards,  each player explores cards,  presented most often in the form of a panorama. Access to some cards require the possession of the proper item or items,  while others present surprises,  enemies,  riddles,  clues,  and other dangers.<br/><br/>You usually take possession of local hosts to navigate in a given environment,  but who knows what you'll have to do to succeed? Roam a med-fan city,  looking for the dungeon where the Syaan king is hiding? Survive in the Antarctic while enormous creatures lurk beneath the surface of the ice? Solve a puzzle in an early 20th century asylum? That is all possible,  and you might even have to jump from one host to another,  or play against your fellow agents from time to time...<br/><br/>In the box,  an insert allows players to &quot;save&quot; the game at any point,  to play over multiple sessions,  just like in a video game. This way,  it's possible to pause your ongoing game by preserving the state of the receptacles,  the remaining TU,  the discovered clues,  etc.<br/><br/>T.I.M.E Stories is a decksploring game in which each deck makes anything possible!<br/><br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tOfficial FAQ<br/><br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tExpansions were published in this order:<br/><br/>Asylum (base game) (2015)<br/>T.I.M.E Stories: The Marcy Case (2015)<br/>T.I.M.E Stories: A Prophecy of Dragons (2016) <br/>T.I.M.E Stories: Under the Mask (2016) <br/>T.I.M.E Stories: Expedition \u2013 Endurance (2017) <br/>T.I.M.E Stories: Lumen Fidei (2017)<br/>T.I.M.E Stories: Estrella Drive (2017)<br/>T.I.M.E Stories: Brotherhood of the Coast (2018)<br/>T.I.M.E Stories: Madame (2019)<br/><br/>The Expansions link below also includes many fan-made expansions.<br/><br/>",

Alliances form and shift from moment to moment,  while cataclysmic battles send starships screaming into the warp.  Players choose from dozens of alien races,  each with its own unique power to further its efforts to build an empire that spans the galaxy.<br/><br/>Many classic aliens from earlier editions of this beloved game return,  such as the Oracle,  the Loser,  and the Clone. Newly discovered aliens also join the fray,  including Remora,  Mite,  and Tick-Tock.  This classic game of alien politics returns from the warp once more.<br/><br/>In Cosmic Encounter,  each player is the leader of an alien race. On a player's turn,  he or she becomes the offense.  The offense encounters another player on a planet by moving a group of his or her ships through the hyperspace gate to that planet.  The offense draws from the destiny deck which contains colors,  wilds and specials.  He or she then takes the hyperspace gate and points at one planet in the system indicated by the drawn destiny card.  The offense vs. the defenses ships are in the encounter and both sides are able to invite allies,  play an encounter card as well as special cards to try and tip the encounter in their favor.<br/><br/>The object of the game is to establish colonies in other players' planetary systems. Players take turns trying to establish colonies. The winner(s) are the first player(s) to have five colonies on any planets outside his or her home system. A player does not need to have colonies in all of the systems,  just colonies on five planets outside his or her home system. These colonies may all be in one system or scattered over multiple systems. The players must use force,  cunning,  and diplomacy to ensure their victory.<br/><br/>",

    "Description": "Xia: Legends of a Drift System is a 3-5 player sandbox style competitive space adventure. Each player starts as a lowly but hopeful captain of a small starship.<br/><br/>Players fly their ships about the system,  completing a variety of missions,  exploring new sectors and battling other ships. Navigating hazardous environments,  players choose to mine,  salvage,  or trade valuable cargo. Captains vie with each other for Titles,  riches and,  most importantly,  Fame.<br/><br/>The most adaptive,  risk-taking and creative players will excel. One captain will rise above the others,  surpassing mortality by becoming Legend!<br/><br/>Customize: Each player begins the game by choosing and customizing a Tier 1 starship. Invest all your money in engines and be a rapid,  yet fragile,  explorer. Put all your credits into an uber missile and watch other players flee in terror. Get a small engine and save space and credits to invest in buying and selling cargo. Or create a well rounded ship,  ready for anything. In Xia,  the choice is always yours.<br/><br/>Adapt: The goal of Xia is to become the most famous captain. Completing missions,  besting ships in combat,  purchasing higher tier ships,  selling Cargo Cubes and claiming Titles are all ways that players can earn Fame Points. The best pilots will adapt to their surroundings,  making snap judgments and changing plans on-the-fly. If you can think on your feet,  you'll do well in Xia!<br/><br/>Sandbox: The real fun of Xia is that each game will be different. There is no set direction of play - players may choose to be peaceful traders,  fierce pirates,  workers,  miners,  opportunists,  etc. The game board is randomly laid out and explored each time you play. Players might choose not to explore at all,  creating a tiny arena for swift and deadly combat,  or explore all 19 sectors and have a large play-scape to exploit. It's up to you!<br/><br/>Modding: Xia is very open to modding,  and the community has already created loads of stuff. See BGG's Unofficial Xia:LoaDS mods and expansions wiki.<br/><br/>",

As your town grows,  you'll modify both your income and your reputation. As your income increases,  you'll have more cash on hand to purchase better and more valuable buildings,  such as an international airport or a high-rise office building. As your reputation increases,  you'll gain more and more population &mdash; and the player with the largest population at the end of the game wins.<br/><br/>During each game,  players compete for several unique goals that offer an additional population boost &mdash; and the buildings available in each game vary,  so you'll never play the same game twice!<br/><br/>The second edition of Suburbia features updated artwork,  larger tiles than in the original game,  a dual-sided scoreboard,  GameTrayz storage organizers,  and more!<br/><br/>",

Great nations protect and provide for their own,  while fighting and competing against both other nations and nature itself. Nations must provide food and stability as the population increases. They must build a productive economy. And all the while,  they must amaze the world with their great achievements to build up their heritage as the greatest nations in the history of mankind!<br/><br/>Nations is an intense historical board game for 1&ndash;5 players that takes 40 minutes per player to play. Players control the fate of nations from their humble start in prehistoric times until the beginning of World War I. The nations constantly compete against each other and must balance immediate needs,  long-term growth,  threats,  and opportunities.<br/><br/>Gameplay introduction<br/><br/>Players choose a Nation and a difficulty to play at,  similar to the Civilization computer games series. After the growth phase,  2 historical events are revealed,  which the players will compete for during the round. Then players take a single small action each,  in player order,  as many times as they wish until all have passed. Actions are:<br/><br/><br/>     Buy a card<br/>     Deploy a worker<br/>     Hire an architect for a wonder<br/>     Special action provided by a card<br/><br/><br/>Players each have individual boards that represent their Nation. There are many ways that players affect,  compete,  and indirectly interact with other players. But there is no map,  no units to move around,  and no direct attacks on other players.<br/><br/>When all have passed,  there is production,  new player order is determined (every position is competed for),  the historical events happen,  and if this is the last round of an age,  the books are scored. At the start of a new round,  most old cards are removed and new ones are put on the display.<br/><br/>Victory points are gained and lost during the game,  and also awarded at the end of the game. The player with the most victory points is the winner.<br/><br/>See 'More information' below for link to rules,  etc.<br/><br/>",

    "Description": "This War Of Mine: The Board Game is the tabletop adaptation of the award-winning video game that pictures the drama of civilians trapped in a war-torn city.<br/><br/>You will enter this experience as a group of civilians trapped in a besieged and conflict-ridden city,  enduring many hardships that often test the essence of humanity.<br/><br/>During day time you will take shelter in a ruined tenement house,  which you will care about and manage by: removing rubble,  searching through various rooms (often behind barricaded doors),  you will build beds,  improvised workshops,  stoves,  tools,  water filters,  small animal traps,  you will cultivate an improvised vegetable garden,  fix the tenements&rsquo; shelled facilities,  reinforce the security of your shelter and should winter come,  you&rsquo;ll try to keep it warm.<br/><br/>Upon nightfall your main duties will consist of guarding your shelter and what little possessions you can accumulate against bandits and raiders. Those in your group fit for such a task will use the cover of the night to carefully explore dozens of the ever-changing locations scattered throughout the dangerous city in search of all the things that a person needs to survive (materials,  food,  meds,  equipment,  etc.). On your way you will meet tens of characters,  each with a unique story (residents of the locations you visit,  thieves,  bandits,  soldiers,  war victims,  refugees,  neighbors,  traders and members of local communities),  each encounter is a potential,  unique adventure. To guide you through all these events you will have the special SCRIPTS mechanism,  responsible for implementing the deep and complex story and a coherent plot (each game will be unique and different than the previous).<br/><br/>Your goal is to SURVIVE until the cessation of war hostilities. During your struggle as the survivors,  you will experience dramas connected with making extremely difficult decisions and choices (you will have to face the consequences of your actions sooner or later in the playthrough). Survival itself will often prove not to be enough. The price each of you will decide to pay,  might be too high in the final outcome. So the goal is really to survive in a way that will let you live on with the decisions you made. The EPILOGUES mechanism will kick in here.<br/><br/>TWOM: The Board Game features a multiplayer experience for up to 6 players,  as well as a solo variant. You will be able to personify one of the well-known characters from the electronic version of the game and face hundreds of new challenges and difficult choices.<br/><br/>The boardgame significantly broadens the original game&rsquo;s universe and emphasises the depth of plot,  yet its main focus will be on human interactions driven by survival instinct and group decision-making.<br/><br/>The project aims to omit the usual boardgame threshold - TWOM: The Board Game is an INSTANT PLAY game,  with no need for reading the manual before starting the adventure.<br/><br/>Experience the simulation of a struggle for survival as a group of civilians facing a blind and merciless war.<br/><br/>In war,  not everyone is a soldier.<br/><br/>",

    "Description": "At the turn of the 16th Century,  King Manuel I commissioned Portugal's greatest artisans to construct grandiose buildings. After completing the Palaces of Evora and Sintra,  the king sought to build a summer pavilion to honor the most famous members of the royal family. This construction was intended for the most talented artisans &mdash; whose skills meet the splendor that the royal family deserves. Sadly,  King Manuel I died before construction ever began.<br/><br/>In Azul: Summer Pavilion,  players return to Portugal to accomplish the task that never began. As a master artisan,  you must use the finest materials to create the summer pavilion while carefully avoiding wasting supplies. Only the best will rise to the challenge to honor the Portuguese royal family.<br/><br/>Azul: Summer Pavilion lasts six rounds,  and in each round players draft tiles,  then place them on their individual player board to score points. Each of the six colors of tiles is wild during one of the rounds.<br/><br/>At the start of each round,  draw tiles at random from the bag to refill each of the five,  seven,  or nine factories with four tiles each. Draw tiles as needed to refill the ten supply spaces on the central scoring board. Players then take turns drafting tiles. You can choose to take all of the tiles of a non-wild color on a factory and place them next to your board; if any wild tiles are on this factory,  you must take one of them. Place all remaining tiles in the center of the table. Alternatively,  you can take all tiles of a non-wild color from the center of play; you must also take one wild tile,  if present.<br/><br/>After all tiles have been claimed,  players then take turns placing tiles on their individual boards. Each board depicts seven stars that would be composed of six tiles; each space on a star shows a number from 1-6,  and six of the stars are for tiles of a single color while the seventh will be composed of one tile of each color. To place a tile on the blue 5,  for example,  you must discard five blue or wild tiles from next to your player board (with at least one blue being required),  placing one blue tile in the blue 5 space and the rest in the discard tower. You score 1 point for this tile and 1 point for each tile within this star connected to the newly placed tile.<br/><br/>If you completely surround a pillar,  statue,  or window on your game board with tiles,  you get an immediate bonus,  taking 1-3 tiles from the central supply spaces and placing them next to your board. At the end of the round,  you can carry over at most four tiles to the next round; discard any others,  losing 1 point for each such tile.<br/><br/>After six rounds,  you score a bonus for each of the seven stars that you've filled completely. Additionally,  you score a bonus for having covered all seven spaces of value 1,  2,  3 or 4. You lose 1 point for each remaining tile unused,  then whoever has the most points wins.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

This version was initially available only in the Nordic Countries of Denmark,  Norway,  Sweden,  and Finland; a worldwide limited-edition release occurred in August 2008 and it has since been kept in print again by Days of Wonder.<br/><br/>The goal in &quot;Nordic&quot; remains the same as base Ticket to Ride: collect and play cards to place your trains on the board,  attempting to connect the different cities on your ticket cards. The map incorporates tunnels from Europe and also has routes containing ferries. Ferries will require a certain number of Locomotives to be played,  as well as other cards,  in order to be claimed. Locomotives are handled a bit differently as well. On your turn you may take 2 Locomotives if you want,  but you can only use them on ferries,  tunnels,  or the special 9 length route.<br/><br/>Unlike the USA or Europe maps,  Nordic is designed for 2-3 players only and has a heavier focus on blocking your opponent and more aggressive play.<br/><br/>Although not an official expansion for this set,  Ticket to Ride Map Collection: Volume 5 \u2013 United Kingdom & Pennsylvania can be used as an expansion for Nordic Countries,  although limited to the three players included in this set.  Nordic Countries includes three sets of 40 trains,  with 5 spare for each colour; the UK map in Ticket to Ride Map Collection: Volume 5 \u2013 United Kingdom & Pennsylvania requires 35 trains and the Pennsylvania map requires 45 trains.<br/><br/>Part of the Ticket to Ride series.<br/><br/>",

    "Description": "(from GMT Games' website:)<br/><br/>They called it the Great War. In over four years of titanic struggle,  the ancient Europe of Kings and Emperors tore itself to pieces,  giving birth to our own violent modern age. The bloody battles fought in the trenches of the Western Front,  the icy plains of Poland,  the mountains of the Balkans,  and the deserts of Arabia,  shaped the world we know today. We are all orphans of the Great War.<br/><br/>Paths of Glory: The First World War,  designed by six-time Charles S. Roberts awards winner,  Ted Raicer,  allows players to step into the shoes of the monarchs and marshals who triumphed and bungled from 1914 to 1918. As the Central Powers you must use the advantage of interior lines and the fighting skill of the Imperial German Army to win your rightful 'place in the sun.' As the Entente Powers (Allies) you must bring your greater numbers to bear to put an end to German militarism and ensure this is the war 'to end all wars.' Both players will find their generalship and strategic abilities put to the test as Paths of Glory's innovative game systems let you recreate all the dramatic events of World War I.<br/><br/>Components:<br/><br/>     316 full-color die-cut counters:<br/>         176 5/8&rdquo; die cut counters<br/>         140 1/2&rdquo; die cut counters<br/>    <br/>     One 22x34&quot; full-color mapsheet showing most of Europe and the Near East<br/>     110 Strategy Cards<br/>     32-page Rule Book including sample game replay (21 pages of actual rules)<br/>     Two Player Reference Cards <br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>DESIGNER: Ted Raicer<br/>DEVELOPER: Andy Lewis<br/>ART DIRECTOR: Rodger B. MacGowan<br/>MAP ART: Mark Simonitch<br/>CARDS &amp; COUNTER ART: Mark Simonitch<br/><br/><br/>(BGG description:)<br/><br/>Following in the footsteps of We the People,  Hannibal: Rome vs. Carthage,  Successors (Second Edition),  and For the People,  Paths of Glory utilizes a similar card-driven system.  The game covers WWI from its outbreak to American intervention and spans all of Europe and the Middle East.  Not only is the game innovative,  but it also plays fast,  usually within just an evening.<br/><br/>While the game itself has all of the normal expectations of a wargame,  with various units,  CRT charts and period chrome,  at heart the game rests within the card play.  Players are given a hand of cards to play out six sub-phases of a turn.  Each sub-phase allows for the use of a card or a pass with a minimal movement of units.  Each card has four possible uses: operational movement,  strategic movement,  special events,  and replacement points.  The cardplay forces players to constantly make tough decsions as they feel that they need to do a little bit of everything but they can only do one thing at a time.  How you play your cards will decide to a large degree the outcome of the war.<br/><br/>",

One villager might want to become a friar. Another might feel ambitious and strive for a career in public office. A third one might want to seek his luck in distant lands.<br/><br/>Each player will take the reins of a family and have them find fame and glory in many different ways. There is one thing you must not forget,  however: Time will not stop for anyone and with time people will vanish. Those who will find themselves immortalized in the village chronicles will bring honor to their family and be one step closer to victory.<br/><br/>Village is a game full of tactical challenges. A smart and unique new action mechanism is responsible for keeping turns short and yet still tactically rich and full of difficult decisions. Also unique is the way this game deals with the delicate subject of death; as a natural and perpetual part of life in the village,  thoughts of death will keep you focused on smart time-management.<br/><br/>Paraphrased from Opinionated Gamer's review:<br/><br/>Each player&rsquo;s turn consists of taking a cube and then taking the action of the area they just took the cube from.  The board has multiple different zones with specific attributes,  a market,  a travel zone,  a crafting zone,  a church,  and a council house.  Many of these offer multiple options,  so even if you take a cube from the crafting area,  you can get an ox,  a horse,  a cart,  a plow,  a scroll,  or convert wheat to gold.  Each zone is seeded with cubes of four colors plus black cubes which serve as curses,  there are lots of turns per round. Some areas offer short-term scoring,  others offer long-term scoring,  and still others offer only end-game scoring. The round ends when there are no cubes at any location.  The game ends when either the village chronicle or the anonymous graveyard is full.<br/><br/>",

    "Description": "Combat Commander: Europe is a card-driven board game covering tactical infantry combat in the European Theater of World War II. One player takes the role of the Axis (Germany) while another player commands the Allies (America or Russia). These two players will take turns playing one or more &ldquo;Fate&rdquo; cards from their hands in order to activate his units on the mapboard for various military functions.<br/><br/>Players attempt to achieve victory by moving their combat units across the game map to attack their opponent&rsquo;s combat units and occupy as many objectives as possible. The degree to which a player succeeds or fails is measured by a scenario&rsquo;s specific &ldquo;Objective&rdquo; chits,  the destruction of enemy units,  and the exiting of friendly units off the opponent&rsquo;s board edge.<br/><br/>A game of Combat Commander is divided into several measures of Game Time. There is no sequence of play to follow,  however: each Time segment is divided into a variable number of Player Turns,  each of which may consist of one or more Fate Card &quot;Orders&quot; conducted by the active player. Fate Card &quot;Actions&quot; may generally be conducted by either player at any time. &quot;Events&quot; &mdash; both good and bad &mdash; will occur at random intervals to add a bit of chaos and uncertainty to each player&rsquo;s perfect plan.<br/><br/>SCALE: Each hex of a Combat Commander map is roughly 100 feet of distance (about 30 meters). Each complete Player Phase abstractly represents several seconds of real time. Each complete measure of Game Time abstractly represents several minutes of real time.<br/><br/>Each unit in the game is approximated as either a single Leader,  a 5-man Team,  or a 10-man Squad.

Every role is important,  and the confrontation is merciless. Be organized and communicate because a captain is nothing without his crew: the Chief Mate,  the Radio Operator,  and the Engineer.<br/><br/>All the members of a team sit on one side of the table,  and they each take a particular role on the submarine,  with the division of labor for these roles being dependent on the number of players in the game: One player might be the captain,  who is responsible for moving the submarine and announcing some details of this movement; another player is manning the sonar in order to listen to the opposing captain's orders and try to decipher where that sub might be in the water; a third player might be working in the munitions room to prepare torpedoes,  mines and other devices that will allow for combat.<br/><br/>Captain Sonar can be played in two modes: turn-by-turn or simultaneous. In the latter set-up,  all the members of a team take their actions simultaneously while trying to track what the opponents are doing,  too. When a captain is ready to launch an attack,  the action pauses for a moment to see whether a hit has been recorded &mdash; then play resumes with the target having snuck away while the attacker paused or with bits of metal now scattered across the ocean floor.<br/><br/>Multiple maps are included with varying levels of difficulty.<br/><br/>",

It contains the spells you know and the creatures you can summon to fight for you.<br/><br/>This is the grandfather of the collectible card game (or CCG) genre.  Cards are categorized as common,  uncommon,  rare,  and mythic rare.  Players collect cards and build decks out of their collection.<br/><br/>Players build a deck of cards and duel against an opponent's deck.  Players are wizards attempting to reduce their opponent's life total to zero.  The first player to reduce his opponent's life to zero (or meet another set win condition) wins the game.<br/><br/>An important part of the game is deck construction,  which is done prior to the actual game by selecting what cards are included in a particular deck.  There are nearly 20, 000 different cards from which to build your deck!<br/><br/>Cards can be lands,  which usually generate mana of various colors,  or spells,  which require a certain amount of mana to be used.  Some cards (creatures,  artifacts,  and enchantments) stay on the board and continue to affect the game,  while others have a one-time effect.<br/><br/>Players randomly draw spells to see what they get and can play each turn.  Although this limits your choices,  there is a lot of strategy in how you play those spells.  A robust list of game mechanics,  including intricate rules for reactive card play called &quot;the stack, &quot; provide for rich tactics and tough choices each turn.<br/><br/>Though traditionally a two-player duel,  there are several casual and tournament formats to Magic that allow more players to play.<br/><br/>",

    "Description": "Codenames Duet keeps the basic elements of Codenames &mdash; give one-word clues to try to get someone to identify your agents among those on the table &mdash; but now you're working together as a team to find all of your agents. (Why you don't already know who your agents are is a question that Congressional investigators will get on your back about later!)<br/><br/>To set up play,  lay out 25 word cards in a 5&times;5 grid. Place a key card in the holder so that each player sees one side of the card. Each player sees a 5&times;5 grid on the card,  with nine of the squares colored green (representing your agents) and three squares colored black (representing assassins). Three of the nine squares on each side are also green on the other side,  one assassin is black on both sides,  one is green on the other side and the other is an innocent bystander on the other side.<br/><br/>Collectively,  you need to reveal all fifteen agents &mdash; without revealing an assassin &mdash; before time runs out in order to win the game. Either player can decide to give the first one-word clue to the other player,  along with a number. Whoever receives the clue places a finger on a card to identify that agent. If correct,  they can attempt to identify another one. If they identify a bystander,  then their guessing time ends. If they identify an assassin,  you both lose! Unlike regular Codenames,  they can keep guessing as long as they keep identifying an agent each time; this is useful for going back to previous clues and finding ones they missed earlier. After the first clue is given,  players alternate giving clues.<br/><br/>",

    "Description": "The battle of Sekigahara,  fought in 1600 at a crossroads in Japan,  unified that nation under the Tokugawa family for more than 250 years.<br/><br/>Sekigahara allows you to re-contest that war as Ishida Mitsunari,  defender of a child heir,  or Tokugawa Ieyasu,  Japan's most powerful daimyo (feudal lord).<br/><br/>The campaign lasted only 7 weeks,  during which each side improvised an army and a strategy with what forces their allies could provide. Each leader harbored deep doubts as to the loyalty of his units - for good reason. Several daimyo refused to fight; some even turned sides in the midst of battle.<br/><br/>To conquer Japan you must do more than field an army - you must be sure it will follow you into combat. Cultivate the loyalty of your allies and deploy them only when you are confident of their allegiance. Win a battle by gaining a defection from the ranks of your opponent.<br/><br/>Sekigahara is replete with unusual mechanics:<br/><br/>        No dice are used<br/>        Cards represent loyalty and motivation. Without a matching card,  an army will not enter battle.<br/>        Allegiance is represented by hand size,  which fluctuates each turn.<br/>        Battles are a series of deployments,  from hidden unit stacks,  based on hidden loyalty factors. Loyalty Challenge cards create potential defection events.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Sekigahara is a 3-hour block game based on the Japanese campaign waged in 1600. The 7-week war,  fought along Japan's two major highways and in scattered sieges and backcountry skirmishes,  elevated Tokugawa Ieyasu to Shogun and unified Japan for 265 years.<br/><br/>Sekigahara is designed to offer an historically authentic experience within an intuitive game mechanic that can be played in one sitting. Great effort has been taken to preserve a clean game mechanism. (Despite a healthy amount of historical detail,  the ruleset is a brief 6 pages.) Chance takes the form of uncertainty and not luck.<br/><br/>No dice are used; combat is decided with cards. Blocks = armies and cards = motivation. The combination of army and motivation produces impact on the battlefield. Armies without matching cards don't fight. Battles resolve quickly,  but with suspense,  tactical participation,  and a wide range of possible outcomes.<br/><br/>Legitimacy is represented by hand size,  which fluctuates each week according to the number of castles a player holds. Certain events deplete legitimacy,  like force marches and lost battles. Recruitment,  meanwhile,  is a function of a daimyo's control over key production areas. Objectives (enemy units,  castles,  resources) exist all over the map.<br/><br/>The initial setup is variable,  so the situation is always fresh. Concealed information (blocks and cards) lends additional uncertainty. In this way the game feels like the actual campaign.<br/><br/>Blocks are large and stackable. Every unit on the board is visible at once,  and the strategic situation is comprehensible at a glance. Components use authentic clan designations and colors,  and have a Japanese feel.<br/><br/>True to history,  the objectives (castles and economic centers) and forces (armies of allied daimyo) are dispersed. Support for one front means neglect for another. The player is pulled between competing priorities. Each side wonders where his opponent wants to fight,  and where he is unready. There is a great deal of bluff in the game.<br/><br/>Each player must rally the several daimyo of his coalition,  managing the morale and motivation of each clan. The forces are dispersed,  and while there are reasons to unify them,  the objectives are also dispersed,  and the timeframe compact,  so skirmishing will occur all over the island.<br/><br/>TIME SCALE     1 week per 2-player turns<br/>MAP SCALE     Point to point<br/>UNIT SCALE     One block = 5000 soldiers<br/>NUMBER OF PLAYERS     2<br/><br/>COMPONENTS<br/>    Mounted Map<br/>    119 wooden pieces<br/>    1 and 1/2 sticker sheets<br/>    110 cards<br/>    Rulebook<br/>    Two player aid cards<br/><br/>DESIGNER: Matthew Calkins<br/>MAP,  CARD,  &amp; BLOCK ART: Mark Mahaffey<br/><br/>(source: GMT website)<br/><br/>",

    "Description": "In La Granja,  players control small farms by the Alpich pond near the village of Esporles on the island of Mallorca. Over time,  the players develop their farms and deliver goods to the village. Players are vying to earn the title of &quot;La Granja&quot; for their country estate!<br/><br/>Over the course of 6 game rounds,  players will expand their farm by adding fields,  farm extensions,  market barrows,  and helpers.  They will earn VPs by delivering goods to the village of Esporles.  It is important to observe the actions of other players,  manipulate turn order,  and adjust your strategy based on the dice and cards.<br/><br/>La Granja is a fascinating game that requires careful planning. Timing and speed is crucial. However,  successful players must cope with the uncertainty of events during the game.

Nestled in the heart of Portugal,  the city of Coimbra serves as a&nbsp;cultural center of the country. As the head of one of Coimbra's oldest houses,  you seek to earn prestige by deepening relationships with nearby monasteries or funding expeditions of the era.&nbsp;To reach this goal,  you must vie for the favors of the city's most influential citizens,  even if you must offer a bit of coin or some protective detail.<br/><br/>Coimbra introduces an innovative new dice mechanism in which the dice players draft each round are used in multiple different ways and have an impact on many aspects of their decision making. While there are many paths to victory, &nbsp;players should always seek to optimize their&nbsp;opportunities with every roll of the dice.&nbsp;Combined with ever-changing synergies of the citizens,  expeditions,  and monasteries,  no two games of Coimbra will ever be the same!<br/><br/>",

    "Description": "Tichu took much of its rules and mechanics from Zheng Fen. It is a partnership climbing card game,  and the object of play is to rid yourself of your hand,  preferably while scoring points in the process.<br/><br/>The deck is a standard 52-card pack with four special cards added: dog,  phoenix,  dragon and Mah Jong (1). When it's your turn,  you may either beat the current top card combination &mdash; single card,  pair of cards,  sequence of pairs,  full house,  etc. &mdash; or pass. If play passes all the way back to the player who laid the top cards,  they win the trick,  clears the cards,  and can lead the next one. The card led determines the only combination of cards that can be played on that trick,  so if a single card is led,  then only single cards are played; if a straight of seven cards is led,  then only straights of seven cards can be played,  etc.<br/><br/>The last player out in a round gives all the cards they won to the player who exited first,  and the last player's unplayed cards are handed to the opposite team. Fives,  tens and Kings are worth 5,  10 and 10 points,  with each hand worth one hundred points without bonuses &mdash; but the bonuses are what drive the game. At the start of a round,  each player can call &quot;Tichu&quot; prior to playing any card. This indicates that the player thinks they can empty their hand first this round; if they do so,  their team scores 100 points,  and if not,  their team instead loses 100 points. Cards are dealt at the start of a round in a group of eight and a group of six; a player can call &quot;Grand Tichu&quot; after looking at only their first eight cards for a &plusmn;200 point bonus. If both players on a team exit a round prior to either player on the opposite team,  then no points are scored for cards and the winning team earns 200 points (with Tichu/Grand Tichu bonuses and penalties being applied as normal).<br/><br/>The first team to 1, 000 points wins.<br/><br/>",

    "Description": "Legendary: A Marvel Deck Building Game is set in the Marvel Comics universe. To set up the game,  players choose a mastermind villain (Magneto,  Loki,  Dr. Doom,  Red Skull in the base game),  stack that particular villain's attack cards underneath it,  then modify the villain deck as needed based on that villain's particular scheme. Players then choose a number of hero decks &ndash; Spider-Man,  Hulk,  Wolverine,  etc. &ndash; and shuffle them together; since players use only a handful of hero decks out of the fifteen included,  the hero deck can vary widely in terms of what's available.<br/><br/>Over the course of the game,  players will recruit powerful hero cards to add to their deck in order to build a stronger and more resourceful deck. Players need to build both their recruitment powers (to enlist more heroes) and their fighting ability (to combat the villains who keep popping up to cause trouble). Players recruit heroes from an array of five cards,  with empty slots refilled as needed. At the start of a player's turn,  he reveals a villain and adds it to the row of villains. This row has a limited number of spaces,  and if it fills up,  the earliest villain to arrive escapes,  possibly punishing the heroes in some way. Some villains also take an action when showing up for the first time,  such as kidnapping an innocent bystander. The villain deck also contains &quot;master strike&quot; cards,  and whenever one of these shows up,  the mastermind villain (controlled by the game) takes a bonus action.<br/><br/>As players fight and defeat villains,  they collect those cards,  which will be worth points at game's end. Players can also fight the mastermind; if a player has enough fighting power,  he claims one of the attack cards beneath the mastermind,  which has a particular effect on the game. If all of these cards are claimed,  the game ends and players tally their points to see who wins. If the mastermind completes his scheme,  however &ndash; having a certain number of villains escape,  for example,  or imposing a certain number of wounds on the heroes &ndash; then the players all lose.<br/><br/>Hero decks in the base game: Gambit,  Black Widow,  Hawkeye,  Emma Frost,  Thor,  Spider-Man,  Iron Man,  Storm,  Captain America,  Nick Fury,  Rogue,  Cyclops,  Hulk,  Wolverine,  Deadpool<br/><br/>",

These signals get the workers what they need,  where they need it,  when they need it to create a just-in-time (JIT) production system.<br/><br/>The setting for the game Kanban: Automotive Revolution is an assembly line. The players are ambitious managers who are trying to impress the board of directors in order to achieve as high a position as possible in the company and secure their careers. With promotions come advantages at the factory,  such as more space to store precious materials and greater prestige to accelerate your ascent. Through solid management,  you must strive to shine next to your peers. You need to manage suppliers and supplies,  improve automobile parts,  innovate &mdash; anything to stay on the cutting edge,  or getting your hands greasy on the assembly line in order to boost production. You must exercise wisdom in choosing which projects you should start,  selecting only those that will give you the upper hand and shunning those that will bog you down or cause the unthinkable &mdash; failure &mdash; which would diminish you in the eyes of the board.<br/><br/>Over the course of the game,  you persuade the board and the factory tender to help you develop and improve automobile parts. You make shrewd use of the outside suppliers and the limited factory supplies in order to appropriate needed part when the suppliers come up short. Because the factory must run at optimum efficiency,  production doesn't wait for you or for mistakes.<br/><br/>Like the process itself,  Kanban: Automotive Revolution proves to be both innovative and rewarding. Game mechanisms tightly tied to the automobile manufacturing theme include:<br/><br/><br/>    The factory manager is a game-driven non-player character with two modes of play (&quot;nice&quot; or &quot;mean&quot;) to offer a friendly or more competitive gameplay environment.<br/>    Two independent player-influenced game timers &mdash; the factory production cycle and work week clock &mdash; provide timing tension to the game,  trigger intermediate scoring phases,  and factor into the game end conditions.<br/>    A simulation of the factory assembly line with spatial point-to-point movement adds an element to the game that requires optimal timing.<br/>    A design and innovation department,  leveraged to manipulate the value of the various car models and component upgrades produced within the factory,  drives the economy of the game.<br/>    Departmental training and certification tracks provide players a means to operate more efficiently.<br/><br/><br/>If you want a seat on the board someday,  you need to show that you can keep a complex machine running smoothly,  efficiently,  with everything happening just at the right time. Kanban: Automotive Revolution is a pure Eurogame focused on economics and resource management that puts you in the driver's seat of an entire production facility,  racing for the highest level of promotion.<br/><br/>",

    "Description": "Description from the publisher:<br/><br/>Zombicide: Black Plague takes the zombie apocalypse into a fantastical medieval setting! The arcane powers of the Necromancers have unleashed a zombie invasion in the age of swords and sorcery,  and it's up to your group of straggling survivors to not only stay alive during these dark times,  but to take back the realm and punish those responsible for the apocalypse!<br/><br/>Zombicide: Black Plague allows you take control of paladins,  dwarves,  knights,  and magicians,  wielding powerful swords,  crossbows,  and even magic spells to defeat the zombie hordes and its Necromancer overlords. The classic Zombicide rules have been revamped for this new incarnation of the game,  while still retaining the nonstop action,  tense atmosphere and easy-to-learn rules that made Zombicide a classic. Equip your survivor with equipment like chainmail armor or shields to defend against the undead,  pick up spell books to perform fantastic enchantments,  or light up a pool of dragon bile to create an all-consuming inferno of dragon fire!<br/><br/>Take on the zombie invasion from the medieval streets to secret vaults that create quick passages through the citadel (and often hold special artifacts). Chase down the elusive Necromancers to keep them from multiplying the zombie masses. And tackle a whole new set of missions through which your group of survivors will become the heroes of the land (or the last victims of the zombie massacre).<br/><br/>",

    "Description": "Goa,  a strategy game of auctions and resource management,  is set at the start of the 16th century: beautiful beaches,  a mild climate,  and one of the most important trading centers in the world. Competing companies deal in spices,  send ships and colonists into the world,  and invest money. Are you on top or at the bottom? It depends on how you invest your profits. Will you make your ships more efficient? Enhance your plantations? Recruit more colonists? Only a steady hand in business will help.<br/><br/>Each turn begins with an auction phase,  where each player gets to auction one item (and the starting player two items). The first item being auctioned gives the right to go first the next turn (along with a card that gives an extra action). If you buy your own item,  you pay it to the bank. If someone else buys the item you sell,  they pay you. Items include plantations complete with crops,  income tiles (income in money,  ships,  plantation refills each turn etc.),  ships,  settlers,  and later on tiles that score points for certain achievements.<br/><br/>After the auction,  players get three actions to either improve their technologies or produce things such as spices on plantations,  ships,  money or build more plantations. Each player has a board showing their advancement for various things: getting ships,  planting new spices,  getting colonists,  etc. The more a player advances along one track,  the better one is doing that particular action. The further you get along a certain track,  the more points that track is worth at the end,  and there are also rewards to the first player who reaches the last two levels along each track. On the other hand,  each player normally needs to perform the actions for all the tracks at some point,  so it's not necessarily a good idea to concentrate on just a couple of them. Goa is a game that gives plenty of opportunity for tough decisions,  since a player always has at least one action too few.<br/><br/>The game mixes an interactive element of the auction,  which encourages you to nominate things that other players want so you receive cash with the solitaire management of your plantation,  which then interacts later on as players race to be first in the top tech levels.<br/><br/>The 2012 edition of Goa includes four new tiles and a new play variant,  as noted on the cover of the Z-Man Games edition.<br/><br/>",

    "Description": "Carcassonne is a tile-placement game in which the players draw and place a tile with a piece of southern French landscape on it. The tile might feature a city,  a road,  a cloister,  grassland or some combination thereof,  and it must be placed adjacent to tiles that have already been played,  in such a way that cities are connected to cities,  roads to roads,  etcetera. Having placed a tile,  the player can then decide to place one of their meeples on one of the areas on it: on the city as a knight,  on the road as a robber,  on a cloister as a monk,  or on the grass as a farmer. When that area is complete,  that meeple scores points for its owner.<br/><br/>During a game of Carcassonne,  players are faced with decisions like: &quot;Is it really worth putting my last meeple there?&quot; or &quot;Should I use this tile to expand my city,  or should I place it near my opponent instead,  giving him a hard time to complete their project and score points?&quot; Since players place only one tile and have the option to place one meeple on it,  turns proceed quickly even if it is a game full of options and possibilities.<br/><br/>First game in the Carcassonne series.<br/><br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tBeschreibung<br/><br/>Eine mittelalterliche Landschaft mit St&auml;dten und Kl&ouml;stern,  Stra&szlig;en und Wiesen.

Wenn dann das Pl&auml;ttchen passend angelegt wurde,  darf der Spieler entscheiden,  ob auf das gerade angelegte Pl&auml;ttchen ein Meeple als Ritter (in Stadt),  Wegelagerer (auf Stra&szlig;e),  M&ouml;nch (in Kloster) oder Bauer (auf Wiese) eingesetzt werden soll,  vor allem wenn es vielleicht gerade der letzte ist...<br/><br/>",

Each player is randomly and secretly assigned to be a liberal or a fascist,  and one player is Secret Hitler. The fascists coordinate to sow distrust and install their cold-blooded leader; the liberals must find and stop the Secret Hitler before it's too late. The liberal team always has a majority.<br/><br/>At the beginning of the game,  players close their eyes,  and the fascists reveal themselves to one another. Secret Hitler keeps his eyes closed,  but puts his thumb up so the fascists can see who he is. The fascists learn who Hitler is,  but Hitler doesn't know who his fellow fascists are,  and the liberals don't know who anyone is.<br/><br/>Each round,  players elect a President and a Chancellor who will work together to enact a law from a random deck. If the government passes a fascist law,  players must try to figure out if they were betrayed or simply unlucky. Secret Hitler also features government powers that come into play as fascism advances. The fascists will use those powers to create chaos unless liberals can pull the nation back from the brink of war.<br/><br/>The objective of the liberal team is to pass five liberal policies or assassinate Secret Hitler. The objective of the fascist team is to pass six fascist policies or elect Secret Hitler chancellor after three fascist policies have passed.<br/><br/>",

Their visits (in the form of cards) are brief but can be very helpful.<br/><br/>Using those workers and visitors,  players can expand their vineyards by building structures,  planting vines (vine cards),  and filling wine orders (wine order cards).

    "Description": "Deception: Murder in Hong Kong is a game of deduction and deception for 4-12 players that plays in about 20 minutes.<br/><br/>In the game,  players take on the roles of investigators attempting to solve a murder case &ndash; but there's a twist. The killer is one of the investigators! Each player's role and team are randomly assigned at the start of play and include the unique roles of Forensic Scientist,  Witness,  Investigator,  Murderer,  and Accomplice. While the Investigators attempt to deduce the truth,  the murderer's team must deceive and mislead. This is a battle of wits!<br/><br/>The Forensic Scientist has the solution but can express the clues only using special scene tiles while the investigators (and the murderer) attempt to interpret the evidence. In order to succeed,  the investigators must not only deduce the truth from the clues of the Forensic Scientist,  they must also see through the misdirection being injected into the equation by the Murderer and Accomplice!<br/><br/>Find out who among you can cut through deception to find the truth and who is capable of getting away with murder!<br/><br/>Roles<br/><br/>Forensic Scientist x1<br/>As the game master,  the Forensic Scientist holds the solution to the crime. They are responsible for assisting the Investigators in identifying the &ldquo;Key Evidence&rdquo; and &ldquo;Means of Murder.&rdquo; When an Investigator does that successfully,  the crime is solved and the Forensic Scientist and the Investigators win the game.<br/><br/>During the game,  the Forensic Scientist is NOT allowed to hint to the solution with words,  gestures,  or eyes.<br/><br/>Murderer x1<br/>When the crime takes place,  the Murderer chooses 1 Clue card and 1 Means card as the solution to the crime. These will be the &ldquo;Key Evidence&rdquo; and &ldquo;Means of Murder&rdquo; respectively.<br/><br/>The Murderer tries to hide their role and look for a scapegoat. Even if they are identified,  the Murderer still wins the game if no one correctly identifies both the &ldquo;Key Evidence&rdquo; and the &ldquo;Means of Murder&rdquo;.<br/><br/>Investigators x8<br/>To solve the crime,  the Investigators must analyze the hints given by the Forensic Scientist. As long as one of the Investigators correctly identifies both the &ldquo;Key Evidence&rdquo; and &ldquo;Means of Murder, &rdquo; the Murderer is arrested and the Investigators win the game (as does the Forensic Scientist).<br/><br/>Bear in mind that the Murderer (and sometimes Accomplice) is among the Investigators! The innocent Investigators must make a vigorous effort to defend themselves from false accusation.<br/><br/>Accomplice x1<br/>The Accomplice is an optional role for games with six or more players. The Accomplice knows who the Murderer is,  as well as the solution to the crime. The Accomplice and Murderer both win if the Murderer gets away with his crime.<br/><br/>Witness x1<br/>The Witness is an optional role when playing with six or more players.* The Witness is an Investigator who has witnessed the culprits leaving the crime scene. They have no way of knowing which is the Murderer and which is the Accomplice and they do not know how the crime was committed.<br/><br/>If the Murderer is arrested but can identify the Witness,  the Witness is considered to be killed,  allowing the Murderer and the Accomplice to get away with murder and win the game.<br/><br/>",

    "Description": "In a galaxy far,  far away... they need sewer systems,  too. Corporation Incorporated builds them. Everyone knows their drivers -- the brave men and women who fear no danger and would,  if the pay was good enough,  even fly through Hell.<br/> Now you can join them. You will gain access to prefabricated spaceship components cleverly made from sewer pipes. Can you build a space ship durable enough to weather storms of meteors? Armed enough to defend against pirates? Big enough to carry a large crew and valuable cargo? Fast enough to get there first?<br/><br/>Of course you can. Become a Galaxy Trucker. It's loads of fun.<br/><br/>Galaxy Trucker is a tile laying game that plays out over two phases: building and flying. The goal is to have the most credits at the end of the game. You can earn credits by delivering goods,  defeating pirates,  building an efficient ship,  and being the furthest along the track at the end of the flying phase.<br/><br/>Building happens in real time and has players build their personal space ships by grabbing tiles from the middle of the table before the timer runs out. Tiles start out facedown so they won't know what they have until they take it,  but they may choose to return it faceup if they don't want it. They must place the tiles they keep in a legal manner in their space ship. Usually this just means lining up the connectors appropriately (single to single,  double to double,  universal to anything) but also includes proper positioning of guns and engines. Tiles represent a variety of things including guns,  engines,  storage containers,  crew cabins,  shields,  and batteries. They may also peek at the cards they will encounter in phase 2,  but they must sacrifice building time to do this. At any time players may call their ships finished and take an order marker from the center.<br/><br/>Once building is completed,  and ships have been checked for errors,  the flight begins. The flight cards are shuffled and player markers are placed on the flight board according to the order markers taken. Cards are revealed one at a time and players interact with them in order. They may include things such as pirates,  abandoned vessels,  disease outbreaks,  meteor showers,  worlds with goods to pick up,  player-on-player combat zones,  and other various things.<br/><br/>Most of the cards will cause players to move back on the flight track and they must decide if the delay is worth their efforts. When all the cards are encountered players sell any goods they have collected,  collect their rewards for finishing in first,  second,  or third place or having the most intact ship,  and then lose some credits for damaged components. Space can be a very dangerous place and it is not uncommon to see your ship break into smaller and smaller pieces or lose some very valuable cargo off the side. If your ship gets damaged too much you can get knocked out of the race,  so be careful!<br/><br/>3 rounds of this are done,  and in each round players get a bigger board to build a ship that can hold more components. After the 3rd round the player with the most credits wins!<br/><br/>",

The Drow house is represented by a deck of cards, with each card being a minion in that player's deck. Each minion belongs to one of five aspects of Drow society, and those aspects correspond to different strategies in the game, e.g., malice minions excel at assassinating opponents' troops, while ambition minions are best at recruiting additional minions and promoting minions to your &quot;inner circle&quot;, which is a special zone that increases their value at the end of the game.<br/><br/>When you set up the game, you create an 80-card deck by shuffling two 40-card half-decks together, with the half-decks being Drow, Dragons, Demons, and Elementals.<br/><br/>A central marketplace has new minions that can be recruited through influence, one of two resources in the game; purchased cards are placed in your discard pile, then shuffled together with other cards in your deck when needed. The other resource is power, which allows you to place troops on the game board, expand your forces across the map of the Underdark, manipulate happenings in the city, and assassinate enemy troops.<br/><br/>Players gain points by controlling sites, recruiting valuable minions, promoting minions to your inner circle, and assassinating troops, and whoever ends the game with the most points wins.<br/><br/>",

Managing that money can be tricky, though. Each turn, each player places two area tiles in front of them and sets the selling price for the tiles. Setting a high price is great, but only so long as someone actually pays the price because if no one opts to buy, then the seller must buy the tiles at the price they previously requested.<br/><br/>In the end, the player with the best kingdom&mdash;and not the richest player&mdash;becomes the sovereign of the island.<br/><br/>",

    "Description": "1830 is one of the most famous 18xx games. One of the things some gamers like about this game is that the game has no 'chance' element. That is to say, if players wished to play two games with the same moves, the outcome would be the same also.<br/><br/>This game takes the basic mechanics from Tresham's 1829, and adds several new elements. Players are seeking to make the most money by buying and selling stock in various share companies located on eastern United States map. The stock manipulation aspect of the game is widely-regarded as one of the best. The board itself is actually a fairly abstract hexagonal system, with track tiles placed on top of the hexes. Plus each 18xx title adds new and different elements to the game. This game features private rail companies and an extremely vicious, 'robber baron' oriented stock market. A game is finished when the bank runs out of money or one player is forced to declare bankruptcy, and the player with the greatest personal holdings wins.<br/><br/>The 2011 version of 1830 was published by Mayfair Games in partnership with Lookout Games of Germany. This publication was developed under license from Francis Tresham in co-operation with Bruce Shelley (the original 1830 developer). This version contains rules and components for Francis Tresham's original classic design, a faster-playing basic game, and new variants from some of the world's best railroad game developers.<br/><br/>",

You start the game insane, and while your long-term goal is to shoot Cthulhu in the face, so to speak, at some point during the game you'll probably fail to mitigate your dice rolls properly and your insanity will cause you to do something terrible &mdash; or maybe advantageous. Hard to know for sure.<br/><br/>The game has multiple episodes, and each of them has a similar structure of two acts, those being before and after you summon whatever it is you happen to be summoning. If any character dies prior to the summoning, then the game ends and you lose; once the Elder One is on the board, as long as one of you is still alive, you still have a chance to win.<br/><br/>The episodes are all standalone and not contingent on being played in a certain order or with the same players.<br/><br/>",

    "Description": "In 64 A.D., a great fire originating from the slums of Rome quickly spreads to destroy much of the city, including the imperial palace. Upon hearing news of the fire, Emperor Nero Caesar races back to Rome from his private estate in Antium and sets up shelters for the displaced population.  Reporting directly to Nero, you are responsible for rebuilding the structures lost in the fire and restoring Glory to Rome.<br/><br/>Glory to Rome is a card-based city building and resource management game with a novel mechanism. Each card may act as a building, a client, a raw material, or a valuable resource, frequently forcing players into difficult decisions regarding how each card should be used. In addition, much of the game is played from the discard pool, giving players some control over what cards are accessible to opponents.  Actions are triggered by a form of card-driven role selection -- the active player leads a role, and other players may follow if they discard a matching card from hand (to the pool).  Players who don't follow may 'think' to draw more cards.  There are thus strong interactions between the different uses of cards.  Scoring is a combination of completing buildings and storing resources, with end-of-game bonuses for storing a diverse assortment. Game length is player-controlled, and is triggered in a few different ways.<br/><br/>The lighthearted artwork of the original editions was replaced by minimalist art in the 'black box' edition, and both have been the source of great controversy.  Many of the non-English editions use more conventional artwork.<br/><br/>",

    "Description": "Hero Realms is a fantasy-themed deck-building game that is an adaptation of the award-winning Star Realms game. The game includes basic rules for two-player games, along with rules for multiplayer formats such as Free-For-All, Hunter, and Hydra.<br/><br/>Each player starts the game with a ten-card personal deck containing gold (for buying) and weapons (for combat). You start each turn with a new hand of five cards from your personal deck. When your deck runs out of cards, you shuffle your discard pile into your new deck. An 80-card Market deck is shared by all players, with five cards being revealed from that deck to create the Market Row. As you play, you use gold to buy champion cards and action cards from the Market. These champions and actions can generate large amounts of gold, combat, or other powerful effects. You use combat to attack your opponent and their champions. When you reduce your opponent's score (called health) to zero, you win!<br/><br/>Multiple expansions are available for Hero Realms that allow players to start as a particular character (Cleric, Fighter, Ranger, Thief, or Wizard) and fight cooperatively against a Boss, fight Boss decks against one another, or compete in a campaign mode that has you gain experience to work through different levels of missions.<br/><br/>",

    "Description": "On November 30, 1803, the United States purchased Louisiana from Napoleon. U.S. President Thomas Jefferson decided to send two explorers &ndash; Meriwether Lewis and William Clark &ndash; to discover this huge terra incognita.<br/><br/>Lewis &amp; Clark is a board game in which each player manages an expedition intended to cross the North American continent. Their goal is to be the first to reach the Pacific. Each one has his own Corps of Discovery that will be completed by the Native Americans and the trappers met during the journey. He has to cleverly manage his characters and also the resources he finds along the way. Beware, sometimes frugality is better than abundance.<br/><br/>Lewis &amp; Clark features dual use cards. To be activated, one card must be combined with another one, which becomes unavailable for a while. Thus, players are faced with a constant dilemma: play a card or sacrifice it. During the game, each player acquires character cards that enlarge his hand, building a crew that gives him more options but it needs to be optimized as he will recycle his cards more slowly. This new &quot;handbuilding&quot; mechanism fits strongly with the historical background.<br/><br/>Since the aim of the game is to be the first on the Pacific coast, the timing and the opportunistic use of the other players' positions are crucial.<br/><br/>",

    "Description": "From the author:<br/><br/>&quot;Sometimes the history of a nation can be defined by the relationship between two individuals. The Election of 1960 is the story of two men, John F. Kennedy and Richard M. Nixon. One is the scion of a wealthy, politically powerful family from New England. The other is the son of a Quaker grocer in Whittier, California. While they belong to opposing political parties, they start out as friends. The complex development of that friendship, however, would shape a pivotal presidential election and cast a long shadow over American history for the remainder of the 20th century.<br/><br/>&quot;In 1960: The Making of the President, you take on the role of one of these great protagonists vying for the right to lead his country into the heart of the Cold War. However, it is not just foreign policy that poses a challenge to American leadership; this is also an era of great social turmoil and progress. As the United States continues to build upon the promise of its founding, candidates must contend with the question of civil rights and balance their positions on social justice against the need for valuable Southern electoral votes. Of course, the ever-present issue of the economy also rears its ugly head, and both Nixon and Kennedy will compete to be the candidate with the voters' pocket books in mind.<br/><br/>&quot;The contest is fought out on an electoral map of the United States as it stood in 1960&mdash;a map where Louisiana and Florida share the same number of electoral votes, as do California and Pennsylvania. Using a card-driven game system, all the major events which shaped the campaign are represented: Nixon&rsquo;s lazy shave, President Eisenhower&rsquo;s late endorsement, and the 'Catholic question' are all included as specific event cards. The famous televised debates and final election day push are each handled with their own subsystems. Candidates vie to capture each state&rsquo;s electoral votes using campaign points in the four different regions of the country. At the same time, they must build momentum by dominating the issues of the day and attempt to gain control of the airwaves.<br/><br/>&quot;As with any election campaign, the challenge is to adapt your game plan as the ground shifts out from under you. There are never enough resources or time to do everything, but you need to make the tough calls to propel yourself into the White House. This fast-playing strategy game for two players challenges you to run for the most powerful elective office in the world, at one of its most unique crossroads. Will you recreate history, or rewrite it? 1960: The Making of the President provides you the opportunity to do both.&quot;<br/><br/>",

Wait for a huge double-sided game board presenting Europe and North America, newly customized wooden parts and an entire deck of new power plants, some of which use natural gas instead of garbage. New overview cards for the resource refill improve game play. An exciting new two players experience is also added - &ldquo;Against the Trust&rdquo;!<br/><br/>The game is still Power Grid, with all the exciting auctions, the nerve-wracking resource speculations, city networks and the competition among the players, all the way to the tight game ending with several players fighting for the win.<br/><br/>The goal of Power Grid Deluxe is to supply the most cities with power when someone's network reaches a predetermined size. Players mark pre-existing routes between cities for connection, then bid against each other to purchase the power plants that they need to power these cities. However, as power plants are purchased, newer, more efficient plants become available, so by merely purchasing, you're potentially allowing others access to superior equipment.<br/><br/>What's more, players must acquire the resources (coal, oil, natural gas, and uranium) needed to power said plants (except for the &quot;renewable&quot; windfarm plants, which require no fuel), making it a constant struggle to upgrade your plants for maximum efficiency while still retaining enough wealth to quickly expand your network to get the cheapest routes.<br/><br/>",

Journey across islands, building huts where the resilient men and women of your tribes can settle, discovering fishing grounds and collecting shells. Send priests to the temples, and gather offerings to curry favor with the gods.<br/><br/>In Bora Bora, players use dice to perform a variety of actions using careful insight and tactical planning. The heart of the game is its action resolution system in which 5-7 actions are available each round, the exact number depending on the number of players. Each player rolls three dice at the start of the round, then they take turns placing one die at a time on one action. Place a high number on an action, and you'll generally get a better version of that action: more places to build, more choices of people to take, better positioning on the temple track, and so on. Place a low number and you'll get a worse action &ndash; but you'll possibly block other players from taking the action at all as in order to take an action you must place a die on it with a lower number than any die already on the action.<br/><br/>Three task tiles on a player's individual game board provide some direction as to what he might want to do, while god tiles allow for special actions and rule-breaking, as gods are wont to do. The player who best watches how the game develops and uses the most effective strategy will prevail.<br/><br/>",

    "Description": "The greatest sorcerers of the kingdom have gathered at the heart of the Argos forest, where the legendary tournament of the 12 seasons is taking place. At the end of the three year competition, the new archmage of the kingdom of Xidit will be chosen from among the competitors. Take your place, wizard! Equip your ancestral magical items, summon your most faithful familiars to your side and be ready to face the challenge!<br/><br/>Seasons is a tactical game of cards and dice which takes place in two phases:<br/><br/>The first phase &quot;Prelude&quot; consists of a card draft: the goal during this phase will be to establish your own 9-card deck for the main part of the game and with it the strategy.<br/><br/>Once the Prelude is complete, each player must separate their 9 cards into 3 packs of 3 cards. They will begin the second phase of the game with their first pack of three cards, then gradually as the game progresses, they will receive the other two packets of three cards.<br/><br/>Next comes the Tournament: at the beginning of each round a player will roll the seasons dice (dice = number of players +1).<br/><br/>These cubes offer a variety of actions to the players: <br/>- Increase your gauge (maximum number of cards you may have placed on the table and in play) <br/>- Harvesting energy (water, earth, fire, air) to pay the cost of power cards<br/>- Crystallizing the energy (during the current season) to collect crystals. Crystals serve both as a resource to pay for some cards, but also as victory points in the end. <br/>- Draw new cards<br/><br/>Each player can choose only one die per turn. The die not chosen by anyone determines how many fields the &quot;time track&quot; would move forward.<br/>In addition, all the dice are different depending on the season. For example, there are not the same energies to a particular season. Throughout the game, players will therefore have to adapt to these changes - also the &quot;exchange rates&quot; of energy to crystals vary during seasons - the energy not present on the dice in any given season is also the best paid during the season.<br/><br/>At the end of the game, the crystals are summed with victory points granted by the cards (minus some penalties, where applicable). The highest score wins.<br/><br/>",

    "Description": "Settlers from four major powers of the world have discovered new lands, with new resources and opportunities. Romans, Barbarians, Egyptians and Japanese all at once move there to expand the boundaries of their empires. They build new buildings to strengthen their economy, they found mines and fields to gather resources, and they build barracks and training grounds to train soldiers. Soon after they discover that this land is far too small for everybody, then the war begins...<br/><br/>Imperial Settlers is a card game that lets players lead one of the four factions and build empires by placing buildings, then sending workers to those buildings to acquire new resources and abilities. The game is played over five rounds during which players take various actions in order to explore new lands, build buildings, trade resources, conquer enemies, and thus score victory points.<br/><br/>The core mechanism of Imperial Settlers is based on concepts from the author's card game 51st State.<br/><br/>",

    "Description": "Dixit Odyssey is both a standalone game and an expansion (Dixit: Odyssey (expansion)) for Jean-Louis Roubira's Dixit, which won Germany's Spiel des Jahres award in 2010.<br/><br/>Game play in Dixit Odyssey matches that of Dixit: Each turn one player is the storyteller. This player secretly chooses one card in his hand, then gives a word or sentence to describe this card&mdash;but not too obviously. Each other player chooses a card in hand that matches this word/sentence and gives it to the storyteller. The storyteller then lays out the cards, and all other players vote on which card belongs to the storyteller. If no one or everyone guesses the storyteller's card, the storyteller receives no points and all players receive two; otherwise the storyteller and the correct guesser(s) each receive three points. Players score one point for each vote their image receives. Players refill their hands, and the next player becomes the storyteller. When the deck runs out, the player with the most points wins.<br/><br/>Dixit Odyssey contains 84 new cards, each with a unique image drawn by Pier&ocirc; and colored by Marie Cardouat, artist of Dixit and Dixit 2. The stand alone version also includes a folding game board, 6 new rabbit scoring tokens (12 total), and a box large enough to hold all the Dixit cards released to date. The stand alone version of Dixit Odyssey includes enough components for up to twelve players and also has variant rules for team play and for new ways to play with the cards.<br/><br/>Expansion versus standalone versions of the game.<br/><br/>     Standalone version is in a square box (released in 2011 but may still be available).<br/>     Expansion version is in a rectangular box (available from 2013 onwards): Dixit: Odyssey (expansion)<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>",

    "Description": "In Space Base, players assume the roles of Commodores of a small fleet of ships. Ships begin docked at their stations and are then deployed to sectors as new ships are commissioned under your command. Use cargo vessels to engage in trade and commerce; mining vessels to build reoccurring base income; and carriers to spread your influence. Establish new colonies for a new Commodore in a sector to gain even more influence. Gain enough influence and you can be promoted to Admiral!<br/><br/>Space Base is a quick-to-learn, quick-to-play dice game using the core &quot;I roll, everyone gets stuff&quot; mechanism seen in other games. It's also a strategic engine builder using a player board (your space base) and tableaus of ship cards you can buy and add to your board. The cards you buy and the order you buy them in have interesting implications on your engine beyond just the ability on the card you buy, making for a different type of engine construction than seen in similar games. Players can take their engine in a number of directions: long odds and explosive gains, low luck and steady income, big end-game combos to launch from last to first, or a mix-and-match approach. Ultimately, Space Base is a game you can just start playing and teach everyone how to play in the first round or two and has a satisfying blend of dice-chucking luck and challenging strategic choices.<br/><br/>",

The threats vary from space battleships and interceptors to different interstellar monsters and abominations, asteroids or even intruders and malfunctions on the spaceship. Players have to agree who will take care of which task and coordinate their actions (moving around the ship, firing weapons, distributing energy, using battlebots to deal with intruders, launching guided missiles, etc.) in real time to defend the ship. Only a well-working team can survive 10 minutes and make the jump back to safety.<br/><br/>The game offers several difficulty levels, huge variability and a unique experience for one to five player teams. One mission lasts only about 30 minutes, including setup and evaluation.<br/><br/>(Based on a description from Czech Games Edition)<br/><br/>",

    "Description": "Two opponents face off across a 'battle line' and attempt to win the battle by taking 5 of 9 flags or 3 adjacent flags. Flags are decided by placing cards into 3 card poker-type hands on either side of the flag (similar to straight flush, 3 of a kind, straight, flush, etc). The side with the highest 'formation' of cards wins the flag.<br/><br/>This is a rethemed version of Schotten Totten with different graphics and wooden flag bits in place of the boundary stone cards.  Game play is identical, except the cards run from 1 to 10 (not 9), you hold seven cards in your hand (not 6), and the rule that stones may only be claimed at the start of your turn is presented as an &quot;advanced variant&quot;. Also the tactics cards were introduced by Battle Line; these cards were only added to later editions of Schotten-Totten.<br/><br/>Some have reported that the production quality of the cards is inferior to the Schotten Totten cards, however, for most readers Battle Line will be much easier to find in stores.  In the second edition of GMT's Battle Line the card quality is higher.<br/><br/>",

    "Description": "Summoner Wars is a fast-playing, action-packed card game for 2-4 players in which they take on the role of Summoners: powerful beings who harness the power of mysterious Summoning Stones to lead their race to conquest on the war-torn planet of Itharia. These Summoners wield terrible magic on the battlefield, freezing their foes in place, draining their enemies of power, and even bringing rains of fire down from the heavens. But most notoriously, they summon their great race's hordes of warriors to the battlefield, to clash in the never-ending struggle for supremacy. A Summoner is both mage and general, and must combine their wizardly might with clever tactics to defeat the enemy Summoner on the opposite side of the battle.<br/><br/>The Summoner Wars Master Set contains six new and different complete factions from which to choose:<br/><br/><br/>     Play as the Shadow Elves and conceal your plans in swirling darkness!<br/>     Choose the Benders and confound your foe, turning his own troops against him!<br/>     Command the Vargath, mountainous goatfolk who call lightning from the heavens!<br/>     Select the nefarious Sand Goblins and delight in malicious trickery!<br/>     Muster the Deep Dwarves and control the forces of Geomancy!<br/>     Lead the ferocious Swamp Orcs to war and hack upon your foes as they are snared in your vines! <br/><br/><br/>Strategy shapes the composition of each deck of cards and how they are used. Tactics determine the effectiveness of those cards in battle. Call walls of stone to protect you in combat and serve as magic portals for you to summon your warriors. Call your forces forth and send them in a surging wave against your enemy. Cast spells that bolster your forces and cut down those who would oppose you.<br/><br/>Victory can come only from the death of your opponent's Summoner...<br/><br/>",

As the biggest event is coming up in just a few weeks, everyone is turning to you with their requests: an elegant coat here, a stunning dress there, or a donation to fund the fireworks at the event. Soon you realize that it&rsquo;s not just about your dressmaking business anymore &mdash; it&rsquo;s about managing the most prestigious ball of the era&hellip;and now it&rsquo;s time to ro(c)k!<br/><br/>Rokoko is a Eurostyle board game with an interesting take on deck-building. Each turn you play one of your employee cards and let that employee perform a task: hire a new employee, buy resources, manufacture a coat or dress, or invest in the ball&rsquo;s decorations. But not every employee is up to every task, so you must choose and lead your employees wisely &mdash; especially since each employee grants a unique bonus and some of these bonuses generate prestige points.<br/><br/>After seven rounds, the game ends with the big ball and a final scoring. Then you gain prestige points for certain employee bonuses and for coats and dresses that you rent out to guests at the ball as well as for decorations that you funded. The player who collected the most prestige points wins.<br/><br/>",

Colonies exist in different places where sugar, gold and spices are available and can be sold to the market to make some money. Money is used to build ships, erect buildings such as factories, shipyards and churches, and to get workers. Workers are necessary to found colonies or to acquire  buildings and privileges, which exist in five categories and therefore encourage players to follow different strategies competing with each other.<br/><br/>At the end of the game the player who is most successful in combining his privileges with his achievements (colonies, factories, discoveries, shipyards, and churches) is the winner.<br/><br/>",

    "Description": "Glen More II: Chronicles is a sequel to Glen More, expanding the gameplay substantially compared to the original game.<br/><br/>In Glen More II: Chronicles, each player represents the leader of a Scottish clan from the early medieval ages until the 19th century, a leader looking to expand their territory and wealth. The success of your clan depends on your ability to make the right decision at the right time, be it by creating a new pasture for your livestock, growing barley for whisky production, selling your goods on the various markets, or gaining control of special landmarks such as lochs and castles.<br/><br/>The game lasts four rounds, represented by four stacks of tiles. After each round, a scoring phase takes place in which players compare their number of whisky casks, scotsmen in the home castle, landmark cards, and persons against the player with the fewest items in each category and receives victory points (VPs) based on the relative difference. After four rounds, additional VPs are awarded for gold coins and some landmarks while VP penalties are assessed based on territory size, comparing each player's territory to the smallest one in play.<br/><br/>The core mechanism of Glen More II: Chronicles and Glen More functions the same way: The last player in line takes a tile from a time track, advancing as far as they wish on this track. After paying the cost, they place this tile in their territory, with this tile activating itself and all neighboring tiles, triggering the production of resources, movement points, VPs, etc. Then the player who is last in line takes their turn.<br/><br/>Improvements over the original Glen More include bigger tiles, better materials, new artwork, the ability for each player to control the end of the game, and balancing adjustments to the tiles for a better suspense curve. The game is designed to consist of one-third known systems, one-third new mechanisms, and one-third improvements to Glen More.<br/><br/>The &quot;Chronicles&quot; in the title &mdash; a set of eight expansions to the base game &mdash; are a major part of these new mechanisms. Each Chronicle adds a new gameplay element to the base game. The &quot;Highland Boat Race&quot; Chronicle, for example, tells the story of a boat race in which the winner needs to be the first to reach their home castle after navigating their boat along the river through all the other players' territories. The &quot;Hammer of the Scots&quot; Chronicle adds a neutral &quot;Englishman&quot; playing piece to the time track that players struggle to control to get an additional turn &mdash; if they can afford him, that is, as he is paid using the market mechanism. All Chronicles can be freely combined, although designer Matthias Cramer suggests that players use only one or two unless they want a &quot;monster game&quot;.<br/><br/>Another major change to the game is the ability to invest in famous Scottish people of the time, who are represented through a new &quot;person&quot; tile type. Persons not only have their own scoring, they also trigger one-time or ongoing effects on the tactical clan board. This adds a new layer of decision making, especially since the ongoing effects allow players to focus on a personal strategy of winning through the use of the clan board.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

    "Description": "Judging by the smirk on the face of the Sultan of Solo, the businessman from North Sumatra has just made a mistake. And a costly one at that, too. He has paid way too much for merging his rubber company with the Sultan&rsquo;s extensive rubber plantations: there are no ships in the area to transport the rubber to the booming cities of Java. And the Sultan is now dripping in cash &mdash; he can bribe city authorities so that his ships will gain preferential access to those ports where they are competing. Or he might invest in building an oil imperium. But wait &mdash; what&rsquo;s that young fellow over there up to? Buying all the shipping lines? That might change the outlook &hellip; considerably, in fact &hellip; let&rsquo;s see&hellip;<br/><br/>Indonesia is a game in which two to five players build up an economy, trying to acquire the most money. Players acquire production companies, which produce goods (rice, spices, microwaveable meals, rubber, and oil), and shipping companies, which deliver goods to cities. As cities receive goods, they grow, increasing their demands. Production companies earn money for each good delivered to a city, up to the city's capacity, but they must pay shipping companies for the distance traveled, even if they end up losing money. Players can research advantages, like greater shipping capacity or the ability to merge companies, possibly stealing ownership of lucrative plantations or shipping routes by buying out other players.<br/><br/>Players keep their money hidden, trying to accumulate the most by the end of the third era. When only one type of a company is left, an era ends. New eras bring new cities, companies, and types of goods. At the end of the third era, the player with the most money wins. However, money earned from the last round of operations (selling/shipping goods) counts double, so it can be important to control the timing.<br/><br/>",

This new planet will be harsh, but if you have the skills to manage your resources, build a fleet, research alien life, and settle colonies, the world can be yours.<br/><br/>Alien Frontiers is a game of resource management and planetary development for two to four players. During the game you will utilize orbital facilities and alien technology to build colony domes in strategic locations to control the newly discovered world.<br/><br/>The game board shows the planet, its moon, the stations in orbit around the planet, and the solar system&rsquo;s star. The dice you are given at the start of the game represent the space ships in your fleet. You will assign these ships to the orbital facilities in order to earn resources, expand your fleet, and colonize the planet.<br/><br/>As the game progresses, you will place your colony tokens on the planet to represent the amount of control you have over each territory. Those territories exert influence over specific orbital facilities and, if you control a territory, you are able to utilize that sway to your advantage.<br/><br/>The planet was once the home of an alien race and they left behind a wondrous artifact in orbit. Using your fleet to explore the artifact, you will discover amazing alien technologies that you can use to advance your cause.<br/><br/>Winning the game will require careful consideration as you assign your fleet, integrate the alien technology and territory influences into your expansion plans, and block your opponents from building colonies of their own. Do you have what it takes to conquer an alien frontier?<br/><br/>Roll and place your dice to gain advantages over your opponent and block them out of useful areas of the board.  Use Alien Tech cards to manipulate your dice rolls and territory bonuses to break the rules.  Steal resources, overtake territories, and do whatever it takes to get your colonies on the map first!  Don't dream it'll be easy, though, because the other players will be trying to do the same thing.<br/><br/>",

    "Description": "Some important links: The Official FAQ, the Unofficial FAQ, and an Automa (solo and 2p) Overview<br/><br/>Dune: Imperium is a game that finds inspiration in elements and characters from the Dune legacy, both the new film from Legendary Pictures and the seminal literary series from Frank Herbert, Brian Herbert, and Kevin J. Anderson.<br/><br/>As a leader of one of the Great Houses of the Landsraad, raise your banner and marshal your forces and spies. War is coming, and at the center of the conflict is Arrakis &ndash; Dune, the desert planet.<br/><br/>Dune: Imperium uses deck-building to add a hidden-information angle to traditional worker placement.<br/><br/>You start with a unique leader card, as well as deck identical to those of your opponents.  As you acquire cards and build your deck, your choices will define your strengths and weaknesses. Cards allow you to send your Agents to certain spaces on the game board, so how your deck evolves affects your strategy. You might become more powerful militarily, able to deploy more troops than your opponents. Or you might acquire cards that give you an edge with the four political factions represented in the game: the Emperor, the Spacing Guild, the Bene Gesserit, and the Fremen.<br/><br/>Unlike many deck-building games, you don&rsquo;t play your entire hand in one turn. Instead, you draw a hand of cards at the start of every round and alternate with other players, taking one Agent turn at a time (playing one card to send one of your Agents to the game board). When it&rsquo;s your turn and you have no more Agents to place, you&rsquo;ll take a Reveal turn, revealing the rest of your cards, which will provide Persuasion and Swords. Persuasion is used to acquire more cards, and Swords help your troops fight for the current round&rsquo;s rewards as shown on the revealed Conflict card.<br/><br/>Defeat your rivals in combat, shrewdly navigate the political factions, and acquire precious The Spice Must Flow cards to lead your House to victory!<br/><br/>",

    "Description": "Imperial 2030 is a game on its own, based on the rules of Imperial.  The six powers (USA, Europe, Russia, China, India, and Brazil) develop their industrial basis and build up armies and fleets.  They fight over control of neutral land and sea areas in order to become the most powerful nation worldwide.<br/><br/>In this game it is not the players who take turns, but the six powers, one after another.  The players are just internationally operating investors who act in the background.  By giving money to the six powers, which all have their own treasuries, the players influence the politics.  The biggest investor in each nation gains control of that nation's government and decides what the nation will do.  As control of a government can change with each new investment, players may control several governments at the same time.  As investors, players should not get too attached to their preferred nation, but rather focus on where their investments have the best rates of return.  Essentially the game is about money, and not about military domination!<br/><br/>Imperial 2030 was released at Essen 2009 by PD-Games and Rio Grande Games. Compared to &quot;Imperial&quot; there will be some new features:<br/>- new wooden bits<br/>- the Swiss Bank <br/>- a new 30 million bond to invest in<br/>- more neutral territory, generating higher taxation<br/>- fewer home provinces<br/>- control of canals (Panama and Suez).<br/><br/>For those who already owned Imperial, there was the opportunity to get only the new map and bonds at Essen '09, as it can be played with the old wooden bits as well.<br/><br/>",

    "Description": "From the ashes of war, nations rise to power in the atomic age. Each player takes control of a nation struggling for power in the latter part of the 20th century. They build up their nation&rsquo;s industry, commerce, and government by acquiring resources, building structures, and tapping sources of energy. The price of oil is going up, and nuclear energy is the wave of the future. The Manhattan Project: Energy Empire is set in the same &quot;universe&quot; as The Manhattan Project, but it's a standalone game, not an expansion.<br/><br/>The major threat in Energy Empire is not war, but uncertain global impacts, that result from side effects of industrialization and pollution. Many actions come with a cost. So, as nations become more industrious, they also increase the amount of pollution in the environment.  Careful use of science can mitigate the harmful effects of industry, and can also help avert global crises.<br/><br/>Energy Empire uses worker placement, tableau-building, and resource management mechanics. On each turn, a player can choose to either work or generate. On a work turn, a player plays a single worker on the main board, then uses workers and energy to activate cards in their tableau. Players may spend energy to use an occupied space on the main board, so no spaces are ever completely blocked. On a generate turn, players get to renew their supply of energy by rolling &quot;energy dice&quot; that represent nuclear, coal, oil, solar, and other forms of energy.<br/><br/>",

    "Description": "&quot;You are a monarch, like your parents before you, a ruler of a small pleasant kingdom of rivers and evergreens. Unlike your parents, however, you have hopes and dreams! You want a bigger and more pleasant kingdom, with more rivers and a wider variety of trees. You want a Dominion! In all directions lie fiefs, freeholds, and feodums. All are small bits of land, controlled by petty lords and verging on anarchy. You will bring civilization to these people, uniting them under your banner.<br/><br/>&quot;But wait! It must be something in the air; several other monarchs have had the exact same idea. You must race to get as much of the unclaimed land as possible, fending them off along the way. To do this you will hire minions, construct buildings, spruce up your castle, and fill the coffers of your treasury. Your parents wouldn't be proud, but your grandparents, on your mother's side, would be delighted.'&quot;'<br/><br/>In Dominion, each player starts with an identical, very small deck of cards. In the center of the table is a selection of other cards the players can &quot;buy&quot; as they can afford them. Through their selection of cards to buy and how they play their hands as they draw them, the players construct their deck on the fly, striving for the most efficient path to the precious victory points by game end.<br/><br/>Dominion is not a collectible card game (CCG), but the play of the game is similar to the construction and play of a CCG deck. The game comes with 500 cards. You select 10 of the 26 Kingdom card types to include in any given play&mdash;leading to immense variety.<br/><br/>Dominion (Second Edition) replaces six Kingdom card types from the first edition with six new types of Kingdom cards, while also replacing the blank cards in the game with a seventh new Kingdom card. These new cards are available on their own in the Dominion: Update Pack. The rulebook has been rewritten, three cards have mild functional changes (&quot;you may&quot; added to Moneylender, Mine, Throne Room), and other cards have been rephrased (while remaining functionally the same).<br/><br/>Dominion: Update Pack contains the seven new kingdom cards introduced in the second edition of Dominion, thereby allowing owners of the first edition to obtain these new cards without needing to repurchase the entire game.<br/><br/>",

    "Description": "This game uses the very popular card system which first appeared in Avalon Hill's We the People game to detail the struggle between Carthage's Hannibal and the Roman Republic in approximately 200 BC.<br/><br/>Hannibal: Rome vs. Carthage is an asymmetrical card driven game for 2 players set in times of epic struggle between ancient Rome and Carthage. It presents a conflict between two super-powers of Antiquity from classical Clausewitzian perspective, according to which a power only reverts to military operations when there is no other way to achieve the goal: political dominance.<br/><br/>Hannibal: Rome vs. Carthage has been designed by one of the most acclaimed designers in the World, Mark Simonitch. Players use Strategy Cards for multiple purposes: moving generals, levying new troops, reinforcing existing armies, gaining political control of the provinces involved in the war, and introducing historical events. When two armies meet on the battlefield, a second set of cards, called Battle Cards, are used to determine the winner. Ultimately both players seek victory by dominating both fronts: military and political.<br/><br/>The 20th Anniversary of the release of this classic game will see the release of a new, revised, updated, and expanded game entitled Hannibal & Hamilcar. This new edition reimplements the Hannibal: Rome vs. Carthage game, and includes the Hamilcar: First Punic War expansion.

I'm on my way now to the new inn they built. I'll change horses there and deliver this load,&quot; he gestures towards the pile of wood in the cart with his head &quot;to the sea beyond. Gonna start some fisheries there. It is said we'll conquer those olive-farmers before long. But their land is even more polluted than ours.&quot;<br/><br/>The farmer nods his head in reply.

It is set in an environment loosely modeled on Italy in the late Middle Ages. Players choose their own victory condition: they can focus on population growth, trade, conquest, or city building by choosing their patron saint.<br/><br/>Each strategy requires a completely different style of play. Or you can choose to adore Santa Maria, the most powerful saint of all -- but you'll be expected to build a civilization twice as impressive as any other player.<br/><br/>While your economy is constantly improving, with more and more advanced cities bringing new options each turn, the land around your cities is slowly being depleted, forcing you to travel further and further to gather your raw materials -- until finally, there is no more land left to farm.

Play time is 15-30 minutes per player.<br/><br/>Thrown overboard for a life of wretchedness, you wash ashore a hostile island ruins &mdash; completely alone with nothing except the breath in your lungs and an undaunted spirit.<br/><br/>Through your advanced resource management, area control tactics, and freeform action selection, you&rsquo;ll add companions to your party, acquire bizarre relics, attain potent character traits, and defeat a host of unusual monsters in the ultimate goal of mastering heroic attributes &mdash; and regaining honor.<br/><br/>You may perform 3 actions on each turn in the order you feel is most advantageous that turn:  activate a companion, travel to a new location, and interact with a map tile. Many actions require the the use of your influence to gain attributes in a one-of-a-kind heroic attribute alchemy system, which is leveraged to gain the game's most powerful rewards. For example, you can meditate at a spire to gain inspiration. You can train at a fort to gain strength. But then you can combine your inspiration and strength to gain the courage (inspired strength) which allows you to perform a bounty hunt.<br/><br/>There are distinctive end-game triggers that can be affected through game play, over 72 unique card abilities that can be merged in unusual ways for potent combinations, and fresh tile placement each game for high replayability.<br/><br/>",

    "Description": "Cthulhu Wars is a strategy boardgame in which the players take the part of alien races and gods taken from the Cthulhu mythos created by H. P. Lovecraft. The game is physically large, and includes sixty-four  figurines of the cultists, monsters, aliens, and Great Old Ones that range in height from approximately 20 mm to nearly 180 mm.<br/><br/>The game takes place on a map of Earth. Each player takes the part of one of four factions included in the base game. At the start of a turn, players Gather Power, then, during a series of Action Rounds, they spend this Power to accomplish various tasks, such as recruiting Cultists, moving units, engaging in battle, summoning monsters, building Gates, casting spells, and Awakening their Great Old One. When all players run out of Power, the Action phase ends and the next turn begins. Victory is determined by accumulating points on the Doom Track. The first player to 30 is the lone victor *if* he has unlocked all six of spell books.<br/><br/>Driving the strategy are a player's wish to expand his power base, and his need to accomplish six tasks to acquire his faction's spell books. Each faction has a unique set of monsters, spell books, and special abilities, and has different requirements to acquire its spell books. All factions have multiple strategies open to them.<br/><br/>The base game supports 2-4 players (the map supports 5 players), but with new factions and maps released as expansions it can support up to 8 players.<br/><br/>",

Gather your gun, your mount, and your grit as you forge your path into the history books.<br/><br/>Western Legends is an open-world sandbox tabletop adventure for 2-6 players set in the American Wild West. Players assume the roles of historical figures of the era, earning their legendary status in a variety of ways: gamble, drive cattle, prospect for gold, rob the bank, fight bandits, pursue stories, become an outlaw, keep the peace. The possibilities are darn near endless.<br/><br/>Each player's turn starts with drawing poker cards and/or gaining cash. Then they choose three actions. Possible actions include: move on the map (how far depends on whether they have a mount), doing a location-specific action (such as mine for gold if they are at a gold mine, gamble if they're in a saloon, etc.), fight other players at the same location (either duel them, rob them, or arrest them if they're wanted), play poker cards that have action abilities, etc. Legendary Points (LPs) are earned based on the outcomes of many of these actions, and the winner is whoever has the most LPs at the end of the game.<br/><br/>Key Points<br/>- Award-Winning gaming experience set in the American West!<br/>- Beautiful artwork, and presentation brings this highly thematic game to life.<br/>- Intuitive gameplay and choices let&rsquo;s you write your own legend every game!<br/><br/>Note: The Russian edition of Western Legends contains 2 expansions packaged inside the box, therefore it has its own entry here: \u041b\u0435\u0433\u0435\u043d\u0434\u044b \u0434\u0438\u043a\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0437\u0430\u043f\u0430\u0434\u0430<br/><br/>",

    "Description": "What would it be like for Mages of vastly different schools and philosophies of magic to come together in an arena and fight to the death? How would an Illusionist battle a Druid? Or a Warlock fight a Beastmaster? Or a Priestess fare against a Wizard?<br/><br/>Mage Wars &mdash; redubbed Mage Wars Arena in 2015 to distinguish it from Mage Wars Academy &mdash; pits powerful Mages against each other in deadly arena combat. Each Mage uses his own fully-customizable book of spells to achieve total victory over his opponent. Summon mighty creatures to do battle in your name; cast powerful spells to attack your foe and thwart his every plan and strategy; use hidden enchantments to turn the tables and rule the day; adorn yourself with mighty weapons, armor, and arcane artifacts &ndash; all of this and more await you in the arena of Mage Wars!<br/><br/>Mage Wars is a tactical board game, a combination of a card game and miniatures game, combining the best elements from each genre. The game is played on an arena game board divided into square areas called &quot;zones&quot;, which regulate movement and the placement of objects. Each Mage (player) starts in a corner of the arena, opposite his enemy.<br/><br/>Each player holds a spellbook, from which spell cards are pulled out as they are cast during the game. This has the feel of being a real Mage, turning the pages of your tome of magic, as you plan your strategy each turn. A point system allows you to choose spells for your spellbook, with more powerful spells and spells outside your schools of training costing more points. You have full access to cast any spell you want each turn, allowing for an unprecedented level of rich strategy and tactics. Many of these spells &ndash; such as creatures, equipment, and enchantments &ndash; are placed on the board and become objects in the game. Creatures can move around the arena, and attack each other and the enemy Mage. Attacks deal damage, as well as interesting special effects such as Burn, Corrode, Stun, Daze, Push, Cripple, Paralyze, etc. Creatures can be destroyed when they receive too much damage, or can be controlled by powerful curses and enchantments, or contained by walls and other creatures.<br/><br/>Every Mage comes from a different school of magic, each with unique spells and strategies:<br/><br/><br/>    The Beastmaster will try to rush and swarm the enemy with his hordes of animals, buffed by his nature enchantments.<br/>    The Warlock will go right for the throat, armed with his powerful Lash of Hellfire, Helm of Fear, and Demonhide Armor. Along the way to the enemy Mage, he'll use his curses and fire attacks to contain and destroy enemy creatures.<br/>    The Wizard is a trickster, a master of meta-magic: countering, stealing, redirecting, and destroying enemy spells and mana. He's also a master of teleportation and portals/gates.<br/>    The Priestess will defend with knights and angels and powerful healing and protection spells. She'll wear down the enemy, then overwhelm them in the end.<br/><br/><br/>The base game comes with all you need to get started: spellbooks, extra spells to customize with the spellbooks, arena game board, dice, markers, etc.<br/><br/>New Mages will be released every few months to add new spells, powers, and variety to the game. The game is NOT collectible, but is fully customizable!<br/><br/>Extra copies of spells available with:<br/><br/>    Mage Wars: Core Spell Tome 1<br/>    Mage Wars: Core Spell Tome 2<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>",

After three ages of play, whoever has collected the most glory wins!<br/><br/>In more detail, the land of Ethnos contains twelve tribes of fantasy creatures, and in each game you choose six of them (five in a 2/3-player game), then create a deck with only the creatures in those tribes. The cards come in six colors, which match the six regions of Ethnos.

In the latter case, you choose a set of cards in your hand that match either in tribe or in color, play them in front of you on the table, then discard all other cards in hand. You then place one token in the region that matches the color of the top card just played, and you use the power of the tribe member on the top card just played.<br/><br/>At the end of the first age, whoever has the most tokens in a region scores the glory shown on the first token. After the second age, the players with the most and second most tokens score glory equal to the values shown on the first and second tokens respectively.

Instead of looking to the luck of dice or cards, players must rely on their strategic abilities. Be sure to watch your rivals to determine which goals they are pursuing and where you can outpace them! In the game, colonists are sent out from Rome to settle down in cities that produce bricks, food, tools, wine, and cloth. Each player starts with an identical set of playing cards and acquires more cards during the game. These cards serve two purposes:<br/><br/>They allow a player to choose actions during the game.<br/>They are worth victory points (VPs) at the end of the game.<br/>Concordia is a strategy game that requires advance planning and consideration of your opponent's moves. Every game is different, not only because of the sequence of new cards on sale but also due to the modular layout of cities on the 4 different maps included with the game. When all cards have been sold from the market or after the first player builds his 15th house, the game ends. The player with the most VPs from the gods (Jupiter, Saturnus, Mercurius, Minerva, Vesta, Venus, etc.) wins the game.<br/><br/><br/>     Teams of two players each may play against each other.<br/>     New personality cards with the goddess Venus allow for new strategies.<br/>     New maps (Cyprus, Hellas, Ionium) on which to play in addition to the classic Imperium map.<br/><br/><br/>The Italia map plus a new map will be sold as an expansion in 2019 for Venus owners.<br/><br/>Note: The Concordia Venus expansion can be found here. The expansion has Hellas/Ionium maps, but not Imperium (which is already in the base game) or Cyprus (which will also be sold with a new map in an expansion in 2019 for original Concordia owners).<br/><br/>",

    "Description": "Your last village was ransacked by barbarians. You barely had time to pick up the baby and your favorite fishing pole before they started the burning and pillaging. You wandered over a cruel desert, braved frozen peaks, and even paddled a log across a rough sea, kicking at the sharks whenever they got too close, the baby strapped tightly to your back.<br/><br/>Then you found it! The perfect place to make your new home. But as soon as you had the first hut built, you discovered a vast network of caverns underground, brimming with shiny treasures, rare resources, and untold adventure. How could you limit your new village to the surface? You immediately start organizing expeditions and building houses underground as well as on the surface.<br/><br/>With any luck, you'll build a village even stronger than your last-- strong enough, even, to turn away the barbarians the next time they come knocking.<br/><br/>Above and Below is a mashup of town-building and storytelling where you and up to three friends compete to build the best village above and below ground. In the game, you send your villagers to perform jobs like exploring the cave, harvesting resources, and constructing houses. Each villager has unique skills and abilities, and you must decide how to best use them. You have your own personal village board, and you slide the villagers on this board to various areas to indicate that they've been given jobs to do. Will you send Hanna along on the expedition to the cave? Or should she instead spend her time teaching important skills to one of the young villagers?<br/><br/>A great cavern lies below the surface, ready for you to explore-- this is where the storytelling comes in. When you send a group of villagers to explore the depths, one of your friends reads what happens to you from a book of paragraphs. You'll be given a choice of how to react, and a lot will depend on which villagers you brought on the expedition, and who you're willing to sacrifice to succeed. The book of paragraphs is packed with encounters of amazing adventure, randomly chosen each time you visit the cavern.<br/><br/>At the end of the game, the player with the most well-developed village wins!<br/><br/>The Kickstarter version of the game included the following items which are not found in the Retail version:<br/><br/>     Villager Tool tokens<br/>     Lost Villagers<br/>     Swamp Villagers<br/>     Exclusive Stretch goals:<br/>     Creature Villagers<br/>     Quest Tokens<br/>     Underforest Tokens and PDF story book<br/>     Desert Labyrinth tokens and PDF story book <br/>     Wooden Goods<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>This collection of items can be found in Above and Below: Expanded Edition Exclusives<br/><br/>",

    "Description": "In Small World, players vie for conquest and control of a world that is simply too small to accommodate them all.<br/><br/>Designed by Philippe Keyaerts as a fantasy follow-up to his award-winning Vinci, Small World is inhabited by a zany cast of characters such as dwarves, wizards, amazons, giants, orcs, and even humans, who use their troops to occupy territory and conquer adjacent lands in order to push the other races off the face of the earth.<br/><br/>Picking the right combination from the 14 different fantasy races and 20 unique special powers, players rush to expand their empires - often at the expense of weaker neighbors. Yet they must also know when to push their own over-extended civilization into decline and ride a new one to victory!<br/><br/>On each turn, you either use the multiple tiles of your chosen race (type of creatures) to occupy adjacent (normally) territories - possibly defeating weaker enemy races along the way, or you give up on your race letting it go &quot;into decline&quot;. A race in decline is designated by flipping the tiles over to their black-and-white side.<br/><br/>At the end of your turn, you score one point (coin) for each territory your races occupy. You may have one active race and one race in decline on the board at the same time. Your occupation total can vary depending on the special abilities of your race and the territories they occupy. After the final round, the player with the most coins wins.<br/><br/>Clarifications: available in a pinned forum post.<br/><br/>",

    "Description": "Arboretum is a strategy card game for 2-4 players, aged 10 and up, that combines set collection, tile-laying and hand management while playing in about 25 minutes. Players try to have the most points at the end of the game by creating beautiful garden paths for their visitors.<br/><br/>The deck has 80 cards in ten different colors, with each color featuring a different species of tree; each color has cards numbered 1 through 8, and the number of colors used depends on the number of players. Players start with a hand of seven cards. On each turn, a player draws two cards (from the deck or one or more of the discard piles), lays a card on the table as part of her arboretum, then discards a card to her personal discard pile.<br/><br/>When the deck is exhausted, players compare the cards that remain in their hands to determine who can score each color. For each color, the player(s) with the highest value of cards in hand of that color scores for a path of trees in her arboretum that begins and ends with that color; a path is a orthogonally adjacent chain of cards with increasing values. For each card in a path that scores, the player earns one point; if the path consists solely of trees of the color being scored, the player scores two points per card. If a player doesn't have the most value for a color, she scores zero points for a path that begins and ends with that color. Whoever has the most points wins.<br/><br/>",

    "Description": "In the 1920s, Mr. MacDowell, a gifted astrologer, immediately detected a supernatural being upon entering his new house in Scotland. He gathered eminent mediums of his time for an extraordinary s&eacute;ance, and they have seven hours to make contact with the ghost and investigate any clues that it can provide to unlock an old mystery.<br/><br/>Unable to talk, the amnesiac ghost communicates with the mediums through visions, which are represented in the game by illustrated cards. The mediums must decipher the images to help the ghost remember how he was murdered: Who did the crime? Where did it take place? Which weapon caused the death? The more the mediums cooperate and guess well, the easier it is to catch the right culprit.<br/><br/>In Mysterium, a reworking of the game system present in Tajemnicze Domostwo, one player takes the role of ghost while everyone else represents a medium. To solve the crime, the ghost must first recall (with the aid of the mediums) all of the suspects present on the night of the murder. A number of suspect, location and murder weapon cards are placed on the table, and the ghost randomly assigns one of each of these in secret to a medium.<br/><br/>Each hour (i.e., game turn), the ghost hands one or more vision cards face up to each medium, refilling their hand to seven each time they share vision cards. These vision cards present dreamlike images to the mediums, with each medium first needing to deduce which suspect corresponds to the vision cards received. Once the ghost has handed cards to the final medium, they start a two-minute sandtimer. Once a medium has placed their token on a suspect, they may also place clairvoyancy tokens on the guesses made by other mediums to show whether they agree or disagree with those guesses.<br/><br/>After time runs out, the ghost reveals to each medium whether the guesses were correct or not. Mediums who guessed correctly move on to guess the location of the crime (and then the murder weapon), while those who didn't keep their vision cards and receive new ones next hour corresponding to the same suspect. Once a medium has correctly guessed the suspect, location and weapon, they move their token to the epilogue board and receive one clairvoyancy point for each hour remaining on the clock. They can still use their remaining clairvoyancy tokens to score additional points.<br/><br/>If one or more mediums fail to identify their proper suspect, location and weapon before the end of the seventh hour, then the ghost has failed and dissipates, leaving the mystery unsolved. If, however, they have all succeeded, then the ghost has recovered enough of its memory to identify the culprit.<br/><br/>Mediums then group their suspect, location and weapon cards on the table and place a number by each group. The ghost then selects one group, places the matching culprit number face down on the epilogue board, picks three vision cards &mdash; one for the suspect, one for the location, and one for the weapon &mdash; then shuffles these cards. Players who have achieved few clairvoyancy points flip over one vision card at random, then secretly vote on which suspect they think is guilty; players with more points then flip over a second vision card and vote; then those with the most points see the final card and vote.<br/><br/>If a majority of the mediums have identified the proper suspect, with ties being broken by the vote of the most clairvoyant medium, then the killer has been identified and the ghost can now rest peacefully. If not, well, perhaps you can try again...<br/><br/>",

    "Description": "Bruges in the 15th century &ndash; culture and commerce flourish and make the Belgian Hanseatic city into one of the wealthiest cities in Europe.<br/><br/>In Bruges (a.k.a. Brugge or Br&uuml;gge depending on the country in which you live), players assume the role of merchants who must maintain their relationships with those in power in the city while competing against one another for influence, power, and status. Dramatic events cast their shadows over the city, with players needing to worry about threats to their prosperity from more than just their opponents...<br/><br/>The game includes 165 character cards, with each card having one of five colors. On a turn, a player chooses one of his cards and performs an action, with six different actions being available: Take workers, take money, mitigate a threat, build a canal, build a house, or hire the character depicted on the card. In principle, every card can be used for every action &ndash; but the color of the card determines in which areas the actions can be used or the strength of the chosen action, e.g., blue cards provide blue workers and red cards help mitigate red threats. All of the action is geared toward the gathering of prestige, with the most prestigious merchant winning in the end.<br/><br/>",

    "Description": "The KLASK game board is shaped like a ball field with two deep holes functioning as goals in each end of the field. In the middle of the field, three white magnetic pieces serve as &quot;obstacles&quot; &ndash; do NOT attract them to your own gaming piece! Your gaming piece is a black magnet. You control it by holding a large magnet under the board. This magnet is connected to a small magnet placed on the field. The purpose of the game is to push the small, red ball around on the field with your magnet/gaming piece, shoot the ball past the obstacles and your opponent and into the goal hole (Klask). It&rsquo;s so much fun when your opponent suddenly is covered in white obstacles or you drop your gaming piece into the goal &ndash; something which might happen if you get a little too eager!<br/><br/>Place the game board on a table between the two players. Place the three white magnetic pieces on the white fields on the board. Put two coins in each point slot next to the &quot;0&quot;. Each player has a black magnetic gaming piece in two parts. Place the short (thin) part on top of the board and the long (thick) part under the board in such a way, so the two parts &ldquo;catch&rdquo; each other. Place the ball in the corner start field. Steer it with the black gaming pieces.<br/><br/>The youngest player starts the game. You score a point if:<br/><br/><br/>    The ball ends in your opponent's hole and stays in the hole.<br/>    Two or all of the three white magnetic pieces stick to your opponent's gaming piece.<br/>    The opponent accidentally pulls their gaming piece into their own goal hole.<br/>    If the opponent loses their gaming piece.<br/><br/><br/>Each time you get a point, you must move your coin one point forward in the point slot. The player who first reaches the KLASK field wins.<br/><br/>During the game:<br/><br/><br/>    If one of the white magnetic pieces sticks to a gaming piece, the game continues; if two of the white magnetic pieces stick to one gaming piece, the opponent gets one point.<br/>    If the ball falls over the edges of the board, you must place the ball in the corner start field in the half from which the ball fell.<br/>    If one or more white magnetic pieces fall over the edges of the board, the game continues.<br/>    Each time a player scores a point, you must put the white magnetic pieces back on the white fields on the board, and the player who did not score a point places the ball in their corner start field.<br/><br/><br/>",

You'll travel the outer rim in your personal ship, hire legendary Star Wars characters to join your crew, and try to become the most famous (or infamous) outlaw in the galaxy!<br/><br/>But it won't be easy since the warring factions of the galaxy roam the outer rim, hunting down the scum that have proven to be a thorn in their side, and other scoundrels looking to make their mark see you as the perfect target to bring down to bolster their own reputation. Do you have what it takes to survive in the outer rim and become a living legend?<br/><br/>In more detail, a game of Outer Rim takes place over a series of turns that sees players taking dangerous jobs, tracking down bounties, upgrading their ship, and more, all in service of gaining more and more fame. Regardless of the path you take to get there, your goal is to gain ten fame, which can come from a variety of sources, such as completing your character's personal goal, collecting on bounties and jobs, delivering illegal cargo, taking down patrols from the various factions struggling over the galaxy, and enjoying the finer things in life by purchasing luxury items with your hard-earned credits.<br/><br/>While the path to victory may be different for scoundrels finding their way in the Outer Rim, everyone starts from the bottom with a simple starship. Your player board not only tracks your fame progress, but also contains slots for your ship, your character card, gear, reputation, modifications, jobs, and bounties.<br/><br/>",

One player plays Jack the Ripper, and his goal is to take five victims before being caught. The other players are police detectives who must cooperate to catch Jack the Ripper before the end of the game. The game board represents the Whitechapel area at the time of Jack the Ripper and is marked with 199 numbered circles linked together by dotted lines. During play, Jack the Ripper, the Policemen, and the Wretched are moved along the dotted lines that represent Whitechapel's streets. Jack the Ripper moves stealthily between numbered circles, while policemen move on their patrols between crossings, and the Wretched wander alone between the numbered circles.<br/><br/>",

    "Description": "The Empire must fall. Our mission must succeed. By destroying their key bases, we will shatter Imperial strength and liberate our people. Yet spies have infiltrated our ranks, ready for sabotage. We must unmask them. In five nights we reshape destiny or die trying. We are the Resistance!<br/><br/>The Resistance is a party game of social deduction. It is designed for five to ten players, lasts about 30 minutes, and has no player elimination. The Resistance is inspired by Mafia/Werewolf, yet it is unique in its core mechanics, which increase the resources for informed decisions, intensify player interaction, and eliminate player elimination.<br/><br/>Players are either Resistance Operatives or Imperial Spies. For three to five rounds, they must depend on each other to carry out missions against the Empire. At the same time, they must try to deduce the other players&rsquo; identities and gain their trust. Each round begins with discussion. When ready, the Leader entrusts sets of Plans to a certain number of players (possibly including himself/herself). Everyone votes on whether or not to approve the assignment. Once an assignment passes, the chosen players secretly decide to Support or Sabotage the mission. Based on the results, the mission succeeds (Resistance win) or fails (Empire win). When a team wins three missions, they have won the game.<br/><br/>Rule Correction:<br/><br/>For first printing (2010 purchases), the expansion rules should read: &quot;Games of 5-6 players use 7 plot cards, games with 7+ players use all 15 Plot Cards.&quot; and &quot;...each Round, the leader draws Plot cards (1 for 5-6 players, 2 for 7-8 players, and 3 for 9-10 players)&quot; - This has been corrected in the subsequent printings.<br/><br/>",

    "Description": "Merchants &amp; Marauders lets you live the life of an influential merchant or a dreaded pirate in the Caribbean during the Golden Age of Piracy. Seek your fortune through trade, rumor hunting, missions, and of course, plundering.  Modify your ship, buy impressive vessels, load deadly special ammunition, and hire specialist crew members. Will your captain gain eternal glory and immense wealth - or find his wet grave under the stormy surface of the Caribbean Sea?<br/><br/>In Merchants and Marauders, players take on the role of a captain of a small vessel in the Caribbean.  The goal is to be the first to achieve 10 &quot;glory&quot; points through performing daring deeds (through the completion of missions or rumors), crushing your enemies (through defeating opponents and NPCs in combat), amassing gold, performing an epic plunder or pulling off the trade of a lifetime, and buying a grand ship.  While some points earned from performing various tasks are permanent, players earn points for amassing gold, which can be stolen or lost (or at least diminished) if their captain is killed.  Points due to gold are hidden so there's some uncertainty about when the game will end.<br/><br/>A big component of the game is whether (or when) to turn &quot;pirate&quot; or remain as a trader or neutral party. Both careers are fraught with danger: pirates are hunted by NPCs (and other players) for their bounty and blocked to certain ports while traders are hunted by non-player pirates as well as their opponents and generally have to sacrifice combat capability for cargo capacity.  Although players can kill each other, there is no player elimination as players may draw a new captain (with a penalty) so it's possible to come back from defeat.<br/><br/>",
